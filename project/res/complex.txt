Preface

Our goal in writing this book was to present a rigorous and self-contained introduction to complex variables and their applications. The book is based on notes
from an undergraduate course in complex variables that we taught at the University
of Missouri and on the book Applied Complex Analysis with Partial Differential
Equations by N. Asmar (with the assistance of Gregory C. Jones), published by
Prentice Hall in 2002.
A course in complex variables must serve students with different mathematical
backgrounds from engineering, physics, and mathematics. The challenge in
teaching such a course is to ﬁnd a balance between rigorous mathematical proofs
and applications. While recognizing the importance of developing proof-writing
skills, we have tried not to let this process hinder a student’s ability to understand
and appreciate the applications of the theory. This book has been written so that the
instructor has the flexibility to choose the level of proofs to present to the class. We
have included complete proofs of most results. Some proofs are very basic (e.g.,
those found in the early sections of each chapter); others require a deeper understanding of calculus (e.g., use of differentiability in Sections 2.4, 2.5); and yet
others propel the students to the graduate level of mathematics. The latter are found
in optional sections, such as Section 3.5.
The core material for a one-semester course is contained in the ﬁrst ﬁve chapters
of the book. Aiming for a flexible exposition, we have given at least two versions of
Cauchy’s theorem, which is the most fundamental result contained in this book. In
Section 3.4 we provide a quick proof of Cauchy’s theorem as a consequence of
Green’s theorem which covers practically most applications. Then in Section 3.4
we discuss a more theoretical version of Cauchy’s theorem for arbitrary homotopic
curves; this approach may be skipped without altering the flow of the presentation.
The book contains classical applications of complex variables to the computation of
deﬁnite integrals and inﬁnite series. Further applications are given related to conformal mappings and to Dirichlet and Neumann problems; these boundary value
problems motivate the introduction to Fourier series, which are briefly discussed in
Section 6.4.

Preface

The importance that we attribute to the exercises and examples is clear from the
space they occupy in the book. We have included far more examples and exercises
than can be covered in one course. The examples are presented in full detail. As
with the proofs, the objective is to give the instructor the option to choose the
examples that are suitable to the class, while providing the students many more
illustrations to assist them with the homework problems.
The exercises vary in difﬁculty from straightforward ones to more involved
project problems. Hints are provided in many cases. Solutions to the exercises can
be provided upon request free-of-charge to instructors who use the text.
Complimentary solutions to every-other-odd exercise and other material related to
the book, such as errata and improvements, can be found at the Web site:

Complex Numbers and Functions
√
Dismissing
√ mental tortures, and multiplying 5 + −15
by 5 − −15, we obtain 25 − (−15). Therefore the
product is 40. . . . and thus far does arithmetical subtlety go, of which this, the extreme, is, as I have said,
so subtle that it is useless.
-Girolamo Cardano (or Cardan) (1501–1576)
[First explicit use of complex numbers, which appeared around 1545 in Cardan’s solution of the problem of finding two numbers whose sum is 10 and
whose product is 40.]

This chapter starts with the early discovery of complex numbers and their role in
solving algebraic equations. Complex numbers have the algebraic form x+i y, where
x, y are real numbers, but they can also be geometrically represented as vectors (x, y)
in the plane. Both representations have important advantages; the first one is wellsuited for algebraic manipulations while the second provides significant geometric
intuition. There is also a natural notion of distance between complex numbers that
satisfies the familiar triangle inequality. Complex numbers also have a polar form
(r, θ ) based on their distance r to the origin and angle θ from the positive real
semi-axis. This alternative representation provides additional insight, both algebraic
and geometric, and this is explicitly manifested even in simple operations, such as
multiplication and division.
Complex analysis is in part concerned with the study of complex-valued functions of a complex variable. The most important of these functions is the complex
exponential ez which is used in the definition of the trigonometric and logarithmic
functions. Since we cannot plot the graphs of complex-valued functions of a complex variable (this would require four dimensions), we visualize these functions as
mappings from one complex plane, the z-plane, into another plane, the w-plane.
Complex-valued functions of a complex variable and their mapping properties are
explored in this chapter.
Complex numbers, like many other ideas in mathematics, have significant applications in the sciences and can be used to solve real-world problems. Some of
these applications are discussed in the last two chapters. In this chapter the applications are limited to finding roots of certain polynomial, algebraic, and trigonometric
equations.

1 Complex Numbers and Functions

1.1 Complex Numbers
Complex numbers were discovered in the sixteenth century for the purpose of solving algebraic equations that do not have real solutions. As you know, the equation
x2 + 1 = 0
has no real roots, because there is no real number x such that x2 = −1; or equivalently, we cannot take the square root of −1. The Italian mathematician Girolamo
Cardano (1501–1576), better known as Cardan, stumbled upon the square roots of
negative numbers and used them in his work. While Cardan was reluctant to accept
these “imaginary” numbers, he did realize their role in solving algebraic equations.
Two centuries later, the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler (1707–1783) introduced the symbol i by setting
√
i = −1, or equivalently, i2 = −1.
Although Euler used numbers of the form a + i b routinely in computations, he was
skeptical about their meaning and referred to them as imaginary numbers. It took
the authority of the great German mathematician Karl Friedrich Gauss (1777–1855)
to definitively recognize the importance of these numbers, introducing for the first
time the term complex numbers that we now widely use.
Definition 1.1.1. A complex number z is an ordered pair (a, b) of real numbers.
The set of all complex numbers is denoted by C. We think of C as a vector space
over the real numbers, and we define 1 ≡ (1, 0) and i ≡ (0, 1). Then the set of real
numbers R is contained in C, and for a, b real we have the identification
(a, b) = a(1, 0) + b(0, 1) ≡ a1 + b i = a + b i .
If z = a + b i is a complex number, then the real number a is called the real part
of z and is denoted Re z. The real number b is called the imaginary part of z and is
denoted Im z. For example, if z = 3 + i, then
Re z = Re (3 + i) = 3 and

Im z = Im (3 + i) = 1.

Note that the imaginary part of a complex number is itself a real number. The imaginary part of a + b i is just b, not b i, when a, b are real.
Two complex numbers are equal if they have the same real and imaginary parts.
That is, z1 = z2 if and only if Re z1 = Re z2 and Im z1 = Im z2 .
We do not distinguish between the forms a + i b and a + b i; for example, −2 + i 4
and −2 + 4 i are the same complex numbers. When a complex number has a zero
imaginary part like a + 0 i we simply write it as a. These are known as purely real
numbers and are just new interpretations of real numbers. Sometimes, via a minor
abuse of language, we say that z is “real” when z has a zero imaginary part. When
a complex number has a zero real part like 0 + b i we simply write it as b i. These
numbers are called purely imaginary. For example, i, 2i, π i, − 23 i are all purely

1.1 Complex Numbers

imaginary numbers. The unique complex number with zero real and imaginary parts
is denoted as 0, instead of 0 + 0 i.

Algebraic Properties of Complex Numbers
We define addition among complex numbers as if i obeyed the same basic algebraic
relations that real numbers do. To add complex numbers, we add their real and
imaginary parts:
(a + b i) + (c + d i) = (a + c) + (b + d)i.
For example, (3 + 2i) + (−1 − 4i) = (3 − 1) + i(2 − 4) = 2 − 2i.
The following properties of addition are straightforward to check: If z1 , z2 , and
z3 are complex numbers, then
z1 + z2 = z2 + z1
z1 + (z2 + z3 ) = (z1 + z2 ) + z3

(Commutative property)
(Associative property)

The complex number 0 is the additive identity: 0 + z = z + 0 = z for all complex
numbers z. The additive inverse of z = x + y i is the complex number −z = −x − y i;
since z + (−z) = 0.
We define subtraction the same way:
(a + b i) − (c + d i) = (a − c) + (b − d) i.
For example, (3 + 2 i) − (−1 + 4 i) = (3 − (−1)) + (2 − 4) i = 4 − 2 i.
Multiplication of two complex numbers is defined as follows:
(a + b i)(c + d i) = (ac − bd) + (ad + bc) i.

(1.1.1)

Taking a = c = 0 and b = d = 1 in (1.1.1) we obtain that i2 = −1. Then observe that
(1.1.1) is obtained as a product of two binomial expressions using i2 = −1. Indeed,
(a + b i)(c + d i) = ac + a(d i) + (b i)c + (b i)(d i) = (ac − bd) + (ad + bc) i.
For example, we have (−1 + i)(2 + i) = −2 − i + 2i + i2 = −3 + i. Also,
−i(4 + 4i) = −4i − 4(i)2 = −4i + 4 = 4 − 4i. The product of z1 and z2 is denoted by
z1 z2 . Multiplication satisfies the following properties:
z1 z2 = z2 z1
(z1 z2 )z3 = z1 (z2 z3 )
z1 (z2 + z3 ) = z1 z2 + z1 z3

(Commutative property)
(Associative property)
(Distributive property)

The multiplicative identity is the number 1; since z 1 = 1 z = z for all complex numbers z. We show in this section that every nonzero complex number has a multiplica-

tive inverse. For this purpose, it will be convenient to introduce another important
operation on complex numbers.
For z = a + b i we define the complex conjugate z of z by
z = a + b i = a − b i.
Conjugation changes the sign of the imaginary part of a complex number but leaves
the real part unaltered. Thus
Re z = Re z and

Im z = − Im z.

Example 1.1.2. (Basic operations) Write the expressions in the form a + b i, where
a and b are real numbers.
(a) (2 − 7i) + (2 − 7i)

(b) (2 − 7i) − (2 − 7i)

(c) (2 − 7i)(2 − 7i)

(d) (2 − 7i)(2 − 7i).

Solution. (a) We have 2 − 7i = 2 + 7i, and so
(2 − 7i) + (2 − 7i) = (2 − 7i) + (2 + 7i) = 4.
(b) Similarly,
(2 − 7i) − (2 − 7i) = (2 − 7i) − (2 + 7i) = −14i.
(c) Multiplying 2 − 7i by itself we find
(2 − 7i)(2 − 7i) = 4 − 14i − 14i + 49i2 = 4 − 49 − 28i = −45 − 28i.
(d) Taking the conjugate of 2 − 7i and then performing the multiplication, we find
(2 − 7i)(2 − 7i) = (2 − 7i)(2 + 7i) = 4 + 14i − 14i − 49i2 = 4 + 49 = 53.
Recall that for a real number x, we have x2 ≥ 0. Example 1.1.2(c) shows that
this statement is no longer true for complex numbers: (2 − 7i)2 = −45 − 28i, which
is not even a real number. What should we multiply z by to get a nonnegative real
number? Example 1.1.2(d) gives us a hint: For a complex number z = x + i y (with
x, y real) we have
(1.1.2)
zz = (x + i y)(x − i y) = x2 + y2 ,
which is always a nonnegative real number. Identity (1.1.2) is very important. It can
be used for instance to obtain multiplicative reciprocals. Note that if z = x + i y = 0,
then zz = x2 + y2 > 0; and so
1

=
zz x2 + y2
is also a positive real number.

be a nonzero complex number. Then the multiplicative inverse of z, denoted 1z or 1/z
or z−1 , is
x

z= 2
−i 2

(1.1.3)

Proof. Note that if α is a real number, then α (x−i y) = α x−i α y. So, taking α =
we obtain

which establishes the second equality in (1.1.3). To prove the proposition, it suffices
to show that z times the multiplicative inverse 1/z is equal to 1. Indeed, using the
associativity and commutativity of multiplication, we obtain

because we are multiplying and dividing by the same nonzero real number zz.

We now define division by a complex number z = 0 to be multiplication by 1/z.

It is not necessary to memorize formula (1.1.4) but suffices to recall that it is
obtained by multiplying and dividing the fraction by the complex conjugate of the
denominator. Here are several illustrations.

Proposition 1.1.5. Let z, z1 , and z2 be complex numbers. Then the following properties are valid:
(1) z1 + z2 = z1 + z2

(2) z1 − z2 = z1 − z2

(3) z1 z2 = z1 z2

(4)

(5) (zn ) = (z)n , n = 1, 2, . . .

(z2 = 0)

Proof. Identities (1) and (2) are left to the reader. To prove (3) we set z1 = a + i b,
z2 = c + i d with a, b, c, d being real. Then z1 z2 = ac − bd + i(ad + bc) and z1 z2 =
ac − bd − i (ad + bc). But z1 z2 = (a − i b)(c − i d) = ac − bd − i (ad + bc), hence (3)
holds. Setting z = z1 = z2 we obtain (5) for n = 2; the case of general n follows from
the case n = 2 by induction. To prove (4), we notice that in identity (1.1.4), if we
replace b by −b and d by −d, the real part of the outcome remains unchanged but the
imaginary part is changed by a minus sign. This proves (4). Identity (6) is saying that
the conjugate of the conjugate of a complex number is itself. It is proved as follows:
If z = a + i b, where a, b are real, we have z = a − i b and z = a − i b = a + i b = z.
Finally (7) and (8) are left to the reader.

Example 1.1.6. (A linear equation) Solve the equation (2 + i)z − i = 3 + 2i.

To find z we only need to change the sign of the imaginary part of z. This gives

Example 1.1.7. (A system of two equations) Find the values of z1 and z2 that solve
the system

z1 + z2 = 3 + 2i
i z1 + z2 = 3.
Solution. Conjugate both sides of the first equation. Since z2 = z2 and 3 + 2i =
3 − 2i, we obtain z1 + z2 = 3 − 2i. Then subtract z1 + z2 = 3 − 2i from the second
equation in the system and solve for z1 . We obtain
(−1 + i)z1 = 2i
z1 =

2i(−1 − i)
2i
=
= 1−i
−1 + i (−1)2 + (−1)2

z1 = 1 + i .
Replace this value of z1 into the first equation of the system and solve for z2 :
(1 + i) + z2 = 3 + 2i

=⇒

z2 = 2 + i

=⇒

z2 = 2 − i .

Thus the solutions of the system are z1 = 1 + i and z2 = 2 − i.



The complex number system, endowed with the binary operations of addition,
subtraction, multiplication, and division, satisfies the same basic algebraic properties as the real number system. These include the commutative and associative
properties of addition and multiplication; the distributive property; the existence of
additive inverses; and the existence of multiplicative inverses for nonzero complex
numbers; see Exercise 21. Consequently, all the algebraic identities that are true for
real numbers remain true for complex numbers. For example,
(z1 + z2 )2 = z21 + 2z1 z2 + z22
(z1 − z2 )2 = z21 − 2z1 z2 + z22
z21 − z22 = (z1 − z2 )(z1 + z2 )
for arbitrary complex numbers z1 and z2 .

Square Roots of Negative Numbers and Quadratic Equations
We end this section by revisiting the quadratic equation. As you may suspect, solving such an equation involves computing square roots. In the complex number system, √
a negative √
number has √
two square roots. For example,
√ the square roots of −7
are i 7 and −i 7, since (i 7)2 = i2 7 = −7 and (−i 7)2 = i2 7 = −7. We need
a convention to distinguish between the two roots. For a positive real number r, we

1.1 Complex Numbers

√
call√i r the principal value of the square root of −r. The second root of −r is then
−i r. Thus, if A is real, the square roots of −A2 are iA and −iA, and the principal
value of the square root is i|A|.
Via the use of square roots of negative numbers, we are able to factor quadratic
expressions of the form x2 + A2 , where x, A are real numbers, as follows:
x2 + A2 = x2 − (−A2 ) = x2 − (iA)2 = (x + iA)(x − iA) .

(1.1.5)

Let a = 0, b, and c be real numbers. As an application of (1.1.5) we factor the

This is Cardan’s formula, named after him because he was the first one to publish it. In the case
3
q 2
+ 3p ≥ 0, the formula clearly yields one real root of (1.1.8). You can use this root to factor
2
(1.1.8) down into a quadratic equation, which you can solve to find all the roots of (1.1.8). The
2
3
case q2 + 3p < 0 baffled the mathematicians of the sixteenth century. They knew that the
cubic equation (1.1.8) must have at least one real root, yet the solution in this case involves square
roots of negative numbers, which are imaginary numbers. It turns out in this case that u and v
are complex conjugate numbers, hence their sum is a real number and the solution x is real! This
was discovered by the Italian mathematician Rafael Bombelli (1527–1572) (see Exercise 57). Not
only was Bombelli bold enough to work with complex numbers; by using them to generate real
solutions, he demonstrated that complex numbers were not merely the product of our imagination
but tools that are essential to derive real solutions. This theme will occur over and over again in
this book when we will appeal to complex-variable techniques to solve real-life problems calling
for real-valued solutions.
For an interesting account of the history of complex numbers, we refer to the book The History
of Mathematics, An Introduction, 3rd edition, by David M. Burton (McGraw-Hill, 1997).

√
√
x = u + v = 3 2 + 11i + 3 2 − 11i,
where u is the first cube root and v is the second.
(b) Bombelli had the incredible insight that u and v have to be conjugate for u + v to be real. Set
u = a + i b and v = a − i b, where a and b are to be determined. Cube both sides of the equations

and note that a = 2, b = 1 will work for both equations.
(c) What is the real solution, x, of Bombelli’s equation? What are the other two solutions?

1.2 The Complex Plane
A useful way of visualizing complex numbers is to plot them as points in a plane.
To do this, we associate to each complex number z = x + i y the ordered pair (x, y)
and then plot the point P = (x, y) in the Cartesian xy-plane. Since x and y uniquely
determine z, we thus obtain a one-to-one correspondence between complex numbers z = x + i y and points (x, y) in the Cartesian plane. The horizontal axis is called
the real axis, since the abscissa of a complex number is its real part; and complex
numbers lying on the horizontal axis are purely real. The vertical axis is called the
imaginary axis, since the ordinate of a complex number is its imaginary part; and
complex numbers lying on the vertical axis are purely imaginary. The Cartesian
plane is referred to as the complex plane, also commonly called the z-plane. It
is not unusual to denote a point (x, y) in the complex plane by the corresponding
complex number x + i y (see Figure 1.1). We can also think of a complex number
z = x + i y as a two-dimensional vector in the complex plane, with its tail at the
origin and its head at P = (x, y).

Fig. 1.1 The complex plane.

Fig. 1.2 Complex numbers as
points and vectors.

Historically, the geometric representation of complex numbers is due to Gauss
and two lesser known mathematicians: the Frenchman Jean-Robert Argand (1768–
1822) and a Norwegian-Danish surveyor Caspar Wessel (1745–1818). This relatively simple idea dispelled the mystery and skepticism surrounding complex numbers. Much as real numbers are represented as points on a line, complex numbers are
represented as points in the plane. Our ability to visualize complex numbers greatly
enhances our understanding of their properties and provides significant intuition.

1 Complex Numbers and Functions

Example 1.2.1. (Points and vectors in the plane) Label the following points in
the complex plane: 3, 0, i, 2 − i, −4 + 3 i. Draw their associated vectors, emanating
from the origin.
Solution. The points and the vectors are depicted in Figure 1.2. The complex number 3, being purely real, lies on the horizontal axis; while i, being purely imaginary,
lies on the vertical axis. Note that one cannot draw a vector to represent 0.


Geometric Interpretation of Algebraic Rules
The vector representation provides a nice geometric interpretation of addition of
complex numbers via the usual head-to-tail or parallelogram method (see Figure 1.3).

Fig. 1.3 Vector addition:
Slide z2 over maintaining
its direction so its tail lies
atop z1 ’s head. The resulting vector is z1 + z2 .

Fig. 1.4 Vector subtraction: To
find z1 − z2 we could take −z2 and
add it to z1 . Or, we could take the
vector with its tail at z2 ’s head, and
its head at z1 ’s head.

Fig. 1.5 Complex conjugation
reflects a point z = (x, y) about
the horizontal axis, resulting
the point z = (x, −y).

Multiplying a complex number by −1 has the effect of reflecting it about the
origin. If z = x + i y = (x, y), then −z = −x − i y = (−x, −y). This allows us to
subtract complex numbers. The complex subtraction z1 − z2 can be performed by
first multiplying the z2 vector by −1, then adding the resultant to z1 . Alternatively,
if we draw both vectors with their tails at the origin, then the difference z1 − z2 is
the vector that points from the head of z2 to the head of z1 (see Figure 1.4).
Conjugation has an interesting interpretation in the complex plane. Since the
conjugate of z = x + i y = (x, y) is z = x − i y = (x, −y), conjugates are reflections of
each other across the real axis (see Figure 1.5).
Example 1.2.2. (Vector addition and subtraction of complex numbers) Let z1 =
2 + i and z2 = 3 − 3 i. Find graphically z1 + z2 and z1 − z2 .

1.2 The Complex Plane

15

Solution. First draw the points in the plane and their associated vectors (see Figure 1.3). Then take the vector representing z2 and slide it so that its tail lies on z1 ’s
head. This gives z1 + z2 = 5 − 2 i.
Reflect z2 about the origin to obtain −z2 . Now add −z2 to z1 as vectors to get

z1 − z2 . The result is z1 − z2 = −1 + 4 i (see Figure 1.4).

The Absolute Value
For a complex number z = x+i y, we define the norm or modulus or absolute value
of z by

|z| = x2 + y2 .
(1.2.1)
√
If z = x is real, then |z| = x2 = |x|. Thus the absolute value of a complex number
z reduces to the familiar absolute value when z is real. Just as the absolute value |x|
of a real number x represents the distance from x to the origin on the real line, the
absolute value |z| of a complex number z represents the distance from the point z to
the origin in the complex plane (see Figure 1.6).

Fig. 1.6 The distance from z to
the origin is |z|.

Fig. 1.7 The coordinates of
z1 − z2 have absolute values
|x1 − x2 | and |y1 − y2 |.

Fig. 1.8 The distance
from z1 to z2 is the modulus of z1 − z2 .

It is easy to see from (1.2.1) or Figure 1.6 that
|z| = 0 ⇔ z = 0;

(1.2.2)

| − z| = |z|.

(1.2.3)

and
If z1 = x1 + i y1 and z2 = x2 + i y2 , applying (1.2.1) to the complex number z1 − z2 =
(x1 − x2 ) + i (y1 − y2 ), we obtain

(1.2.4)
|z1 − z2 | = (x1 − x2 )2 + (y1 − y2 )2 ,

16

1 Complex Numbers and Functions

which is the familiar formula for distance between the points (x1 , y1 ) and (x2 , y2 ).
Thus |z1 − z2 | has a concrete geometric interpretation as the distance between (the
points) z1 and z2 (see Figure 1.7).
Example 1.2.3. (The absolute value as a distance)
(a) For z1 = 2 + 4 i and z2 = 5 + i, we have


√
√
|z1 | = 22 + 42 = 2 5 ≈ 4.472,
|z2 | = 52 + 12 = 26 ≈ 5.099.
Thus we see that |z1 | < |z2 |. Geometrically, this means that z2 lies farther from the
origin in the complex plane (see Figure 1.8).
(b) The distance between z1 and z2 is

√
√
|z1 − z2 | = (2 − 5)2 + (4 − 1)2 = 18 = 3 2 ≈ 4.24.
This distance is also the length of the vector z1 − z2 ; see Figures 1.7 and 1.8.



Note that in Example 1.2.3(a) we compared the sizes of z1 and z2 and not the
numbers themselves. In general, it does not make sense to write an inequality such
as z1 ≤ z2 or z2 ≤ z1 , unless z1 and z2 are real. This is because the complex numbers
do not have a linear ordering like the real numbers.
We can use the geometric interpretation of the absolute value in describing subsets of the complex numbers as subsets of the plane.
Example 1.2.4. (Circles, disks, and ellipses)
(a) Find and plot all complex numbers z satisfying
|z + 4 − i| = 2.

(1.2.5)

(b) Find and plot the points z in the complex plane satisfying
|z + 4 − i| ≤ 2.

(1.2.6)

(c) Find and plot all complex numbers z such that
√
|z + 2 + 2i| + |z + 1 + i| = 3 2.

(1.2.7)

Solution. (a) In these questions, when we write an absolute value of the form |z − z0 |
we interpret it as a distance between z and z0 . Thus (1.2.5) is equivalent to
|z − (−4 + i)| = 2.
Reading the absolute value as a distance, the question becomes: What are the points
z whose distance to −4 + i is 2? Now the answer is obvious:

1.2 The Complex Plane

17

|z − (−4 + i)| = 2 ⇔ z lies on the circle centered at −4 + i, with radius 2.
(See Figure 1.9.) The Cartesian equation of the circle is (x + 4)2 + (y − 1)2 = 4. To
derive this equation, write z = x + i y and use (1.2.4). Thus

|z − (−4 + i)| = 2 ⇔ |(x + 4) + i(y − 1)| = 2 ⇔ (x + 4)2 + (y − 1)2 = 2,
and the Cartesian equation of the circle follows upon squaring both sides.
(b) Reading the absolute value as a distance, we ask: What are the points z whose
distance to −4 + i is less than or equal to 2? The answer is clear:
|z − (−4 + i)| ≤ 2 ⇔ z lies inside or on the circle centered at − 4 + i, with radius 2.
In other words, z lies in the disk centered at −4 + i, with radius 2 (Figure 1.9).

1.2.4(a).

(c) Write (1.2.7) in the form
√
|z − (−2 − 2i)| + |z − (−1 − i)| = 3 2.
This time we are looking for all points z the sum of whose√distances to the two
points z1 = −2 − 2i and z2 = −1 − i is constant and equals 3 2. From elementary
geometry,
we know this is the ellipse with foci1 located at z1 and z2 , and major axis

3 2. (See Figure 1.10.) Notice that this ellipse passes through the origin.
The absolute value of complex numbers satisfies many interesting properties that
include and extend all those of the absolute value of real numbers.

Remark 1.2.6. If z complex number, notice that zz is always a nonnegative real
number, so there is no problem in taking the square root in (1.2.8) and the two
identities in (1.2.8) are equivalent.
Proof. Write z = x + i y. Squaring both sides of (1.2.1) we obtain

and (1.2.8) follows. Using (1.2.1) with z = x − i y, we find

|z1 z2 |2 = (z1 z2 ) (z1 z2 ) = (z1 z2 ) (z1 z2 ) = (z1 z1 )(z2 z2 ) = |z1 |2 |z2 |2
and (1.2.10) follows by taking square roots. The proof of (1.2.11) follows by induction from the case n = 2, while (1.2.12) is a special case of (1.2.11). Replacing z1

In addition to the identities that we just proved, the absolute value satisfies fundamental inequalities, which are in some cases immediate consequences of elementary
facts from geometry. We recall three facts from geometry:
• In a right triangle, the hypotenuse is equal to the square root of the sum of the
squares of the two other sides, hence it is larger than either one of the other sides.
• In a triangle, each side is smaller than the sum of the two other sides.
• In a triangle, the length of one side is larger than the difference of the two other
sides.
Proposition 1.2.8. (Absolute Value Inequalities) Let z, z1 , z2 , . . . be complex numbers. We have
| Re z| ≤ |z|,

| Im z| ≤ |z|;

|z| ≤ | Re z| + | Im z|.

(1.2.14)
(1.2.15)

The absolute value of the sum z1 + z2 satisfies the fundamental inequality
|z1 + z2 | ≤ |z1 | + |z2 |,
known as the triangle inequality. More generally, we have

(1.2.16)

20

1 Complex Numbers and Functions

|z1 + z2 + · · · + zn | ≤ |z1 | + |z2 | + · · · + |zn |.

(1.2.17)

The absolute value of the difference z1 − z2 satisfies
|z1 − z2 | ≤ |z1 | + |z2 |.

(1.2.18)

Moreover, we have the lower estimates

and



|z1 + z2 | ≥ |z1 | − |z2 |,

(1.2.19)



|z1 − z2 | ≥ |z1 | − |z2 |.

(1.2.20)

Proof. Consider a nondegenerate right triangle with vertices at 0, z = (x, y), and
Re z = x, as shown in Figure 1.11. The sides of the triangle are | Re z| = |x|, | Im z| =
|y|, and the hypotenuse is |z|. Since the hypothenuse is larger than either of the other
two sides, we obtain (1.2.14). Since the sum of two sides in a triangle is larger
than the third side, we obtain (1.2.15). Of course, (1.2.14) and (1.2.15) are also
consequences of the inequalities



|x| ≤ x2 + y2 , |y| ≤ x2 + y2 , and
x2 + y2 ≤ |x| + |y|,
which are straightforward to prove.

Fig. 1.12 Ineq. (1.2.16).

Fig. 1.13 Ineq. (1.2.20).

A geometric proof of the triangle inequality (1.2.16) is contained in Figure 1.12
where a triangle with sides |z1 + z2 |, |z1 |, and |z2 | appears. Then |z1 + z2 | ≤ |z1 | + |z2 |
is a consequence of the fact that the sum |z1 | + |z2 | of two sides is larger than the
length of the third side, which is |z1 + z2 |. The triangle in Figure 1.13 with vertices
at 0, z1 , and z2 provides a geometric proof of the lower triangle inequality (1.2.20):
The length |z1 − z2 | of the side of triangle is at least as big as the differences of the
other two sides which are |z1 | − |z2 | and |z2 | − |z1 | .
Since the triangle inequality (1.2.16) is fundamental in the development of complex analysis, we also offer an algebraic proof. Start by observing that
z1 z2 = z1 z2 = z1 z2 .

1.2 The Complex Plane

21

For an arbitrary complex number w we have w + w = 2 Re w, and thus we obtain
z1 z2 + z1 z2 = z1 z2 + z1 z2 = 2 Re (z1 z2 ).
Using this interesting identity, along with (1.2.8) and basic properties of complex
conjugation, we obtain
|z1 + z2 |2 = (z1 + z2 )(z1 + z2 ) = (z1 + z2 )(z1 + z2 )
= z1 z1 + z2 z2 + z1 z2 + z1 z2 = |z1 |2 + |z2 |2 + z1 z2 + z1 z2
= |z1 |2 + |z2 |2 + 2 Re (z1 z2 )
≤ |z1 |2 + |z2 |2 + 2|z1 z2 |
= |z1 |2 + |z2 |2 + 2|z1 | |z2 |

(by (1.2.14))

= |z1 |2 + |z2 |2 + 2|z1 | |z2 | (by (1.2.9) and |z2 | = |z2 |)
= (|z1 | + |z2 |)2 ,
and (1.2.16) follows upon taking square roots on both sides. Next, notice that
(1.2.17) is obtained by a repeated applications of (1.2.16), while (1.2.18) is deduced
from (1.2.16) replacing z2 by −z2 .
Replacing z1 by z1 − z2 in (1.2.16), we obtain |z1 | ≤ |z1 − z2 | + |z2 |, and so
|z1 − z2 | ≥ |z1 | − |z2 |.
Reversing the roles of z1 and z2 , and realizing that |z2 − z1 | = |z1 − z2 |, we also have
|z1 − z2 | ≥ |z2 | − |z1 |.


Putting these two together, we conclude |z1 − z2 | ≥ |z1 | − |z2 |, which proves inequality in (1.2.20). Finally, we deduce (1.2.19) replacing z2 by −z2 .

The triangle inequality is used extensively in proofs to provide estimates on the
sizes of complex-valued expressions. We illustrate such applications via examples.
Example 1.2.9. (Estimating the size of an absolute value) What is an upper bound
for |z5 − 4| if |z| ≤ 1?
Solution. Applying the triangle inequality, we get
|z5 − 4| ≤ |z5 | + 4 = |z|5 + 4 ≤ 1 + 4 = 5,
because |z| ≤ 1. Hence if |z| ≤ 1, an upper bound for |z5 − 4| is 5.
Can we find a number smaller than 5 that is also an upper bound, or is 5 the least
upper bound? It is easy to see that for z = −1, we have |z5 − 4| = |(−1)5 − 4| =
|−1−4| = 5. Thus, the upper bound 5 is best possible. You should be cautioned that,
in general, the triangle inequality is considered a crude inequality, which means that
it will not yield least upper bound estimates as it did in this case. See Exercise 38
for an illustration of this fact.

The last example of this section illustrates a classical trick when dealing with
inequalities. It consists of adding and subtracting a number in order to transform an
expression into a form that contains familiar terms.
Example 1.2.11. (Techniques with absolute values)
(a) What is an upper bound for |z − 3| if |z − i| ≤ 1?
(b) What is a lower bound for |z − 3| if |z − i| ≤ 1?
Solution. (a) We wish to estimate the size of |z − 3| given some information about
|z − i|. The trick is to add and subtract i, then use the triangle inequality as follows:
|z − 3| = |z − i + i − 3| = |(z − i) + (−3 + i)|

since |z − i| ≤ 1. Thus an upper bound is 1 + 10.

equality in the triangle inequality if and only if Re (z1 z2 ) = |z1 | |z2 |. Show that this is the case if

1.3 Polar Form
In the previous section, we represented complex numbers as points in the plane with
Cartesian coordinates. In this section, we introduce an alternative way to describe
complex numbers, the polar representation or polar form. This form enables us
to take advantage of geometric insight as follows: We think of a complex number
z = x + i y as a point (x, y) in the complex plane. If P = (x, y) = (0, 0) is a point
in Cartesian coordinates, we identify it with the pair (r, θ ), where r is the distance
from P to the origin O, and θ is the angle between the x-axis and the ray OP. We
allow θ to be negative if the point P lies in the lower half space.

26

1 Complex Numbers and Functions

Definition 1.3.1. (Polar Form of Complex Numbers) Let z = x + i y be a nonzero
complex number. We define a number r > 0 by setting

r = x2 + y2 > 0,
(1.3.1)
and we let θ be an angle2 such that
cos θ = 

x
x2 + y2

x

sin θ = 

y

y
r

(r = 0).

(1.3.2)

Then we call r the modulus of z and θ an argument of z. Then we can write
z = r(cos θ + i sin θ ),

(1.3.3)

and this is called the polar representation of a complex number z = 0. The argument of z is not defined when z = 0 or equivalently when r = 0.
Identities (1.3.2) are derived from
trigonometrical considerations. In fact, r
is the distance from P to the origin O
and θ can be chosen to be the angle
between the ray OP and the positive xsemiaxis. To visualize the situation consider the case x, y > 0. Then consider the
triangle formed by the point P, the origin,
and the projection of P onto the x-axis.
The hypotenuse of this triangle is r while
x is equal to r times the cosine of the adjacent angle, while y is equal to r times the
sine of the opposite angle; in both cases
the angle is θ . See Figure 1.14

Fig. 1.14 Polar representation of
the complex number z = x + i y.

Rewriting the identities (1.3.2) as follows
Re z = r cos θ ,

Im z = r sin θ ,

(1.3.4)

and dividing we obtain
tan θ =

Im z y
=
Re z x

(x = 0).

Using (1.3.1) and (1.2.8) we obtain

√
r = x2 + y2 = |z| = z z.
It is easy to see that
2

such a θ exists since x/r and y/r satisfy (x/r)2 + (y/r)2 = 1.

(1.3.5)

(1.3.6)

1.3 Polar Form

27

|z| = 1 ⇔ r = 1 ⇔ z = cos θ + i sin θ , for some real θ .

(1.3.7)

A complex number z such that |z| = 1 is called unimodular. See Exercise 30 for
basic properties of unimodular numbers.
We now shift our attention to the argument, whose choice is more delicate. If
θ is an angle that satisfies (1.3.2), then θ + 2kπ (k = 0, ±1, ±2, . . .) will also satisfy (1.3.2), because the cosine and sine are 2π -periodic functions. Thus, relations
(1.3.2) do not determine a unique value of argument z. If we restrict the choice of
θ to the interval −π < θ ≤ π , then there is a unique value of θ that satisfies (1.3.2).
Definition 1.3.2. The principal value of the argument of a complex number z =
x + i y is the unique number Arg z with the following properties:
−π < Arg z ≤ π ,

cos( Arg z) =

x
,
|z|

y
.
|z|

sin( Arg z) =

(1.3.8)

The set of all values of the argument is denoted by
arg z = { Arg z + 2kπ : k = 0, ±1, ±2, . . .} .

(1.3.9)

Unlike Arg z, which is single-valued, arg z is multi-valued or a set-valued function. For a set S and a number c we write
c + S = {c + s : s ∈ S}
and
cS = {cs : s ∈ S}.
With this notation in mind, expressions of the form arg z + π or − arg z make sense.
Sometimes we abuse notation and write arg z = θ + 2kπ or simply arg z = θ to
denote a specific value of the argument from the set arg z.
Table 1 contains some special trigonometric values that will be useful in the examples and exercises.

(f) z6 = −1 − i

These numbers are shown in Figure 1.15
plotted in the complex plane.

Fig. 1.15 z1 through z6 .

Solution. (a) From (1.3.1), r = |z1 | = 52 = 5. An argument of z1 is clearly θ = 0,
hence {2kπ : k = 0, ±1, ±2, . . .} is the set of all arguments of z1 . Its polar representation is
z1 = 5 = 5(cos 0 + i sin 0).
(b) Here r = |z2 | = | − 3i| = 3, and, from Figure 1.15, arg z2 = 32π + 2kπ ; thus the
polar representation of z2 is

which is the polar form of z4 , with arg z4 = π4 .
(e) It is clear from Figure 1.15 that z5 is the reflection of z4 = 1 + i about the xaxis (equivalently, √
z5 = z4 ). Hence z5 and z4 have the same moduli and opposite
arguments. So r = 2, arg z5 = − π4 , and the polar representation is

arg z6 = arg z4 + π . So, r = 2, arg z6 = π4 + π = 54π , and the polar representation is

The following properties of the argument were illustrated in Example 1.3.3(e)
and (f); for a proof we refer to Exercise 26:
arg z = − arg z,

(1.3.10)

arg(−z) = arg z + π .

(1.3.11)

Example 1.3.4. (Principal argument) Compute Arg z j , where z j is as in the preceding example for j = 1, . . . , 6.
Solution. In each case we recall z j and arg z j from the previous example. To get
Arg z j we pick the value of arg z that lies in the interval (−π , π ]. Refer to Figure 1.15
for illustration.
(a) z1 = 5, arg(5) = 0 + 2kπ . Since 0 is in the interval (−π , π ], we also have
Arg z1 = 0.
(b) z2 = −3i, arg z2 = 32π + 2kπ . To determine Arg z2 , we must pick the unique value
of arg z2 that lies in the interval (−π , π ]. From Figure 1.15, we see that Arg z2 = − π2 ,
which is the value of arg z2 = 32π + 2kπ that corresponds to k = −1.
√
(c) z3 = 3 + i, arg z3 = π6 + 2kπ , and so Arg z3 = π6 , because π6 is in (−π , π ].
(d) z4 = 1 + i, arg z4 = π4 + 2kπ , and so Arg z4 = π4 .
(e) z5 = 1 − i, arg z5 = − π4 , and so Arg z5 = − π4 .
(f) z6 = −1 − i, arg z6 = 54π + 2kπ , and so Arg z6 = − 34π , which is the value of arg z6
that corresponds to k = −1.

It is important to keep in mind that while Arg z is a particular value of arg z, the
function Arg z does not necessarily satisfy the same properties as arg z. In particular,
identities (1.3.10), (1.3.11), and several others discussed in this section that hold for
arg z may not hold for Arg z. Parts (d) and (f) of Example 1.3.3 show that (1.3.11) is
not true if we use Arg z in place of arg z.
It is tempting to compute the argument θ of a complex number z = x + i y by
taking the inverse tangent on both sides of (1.3.5) and writing θ = tan−1 xy . This
formula is true only if θ is in the interval (− π2 , π2 ), because the inverse tangent takes
its values in the interval (− π2 , π2 ) (see Figure 1.16); and so it will not yield values
of θ that are outside this interval. For example, if θ = 43π , from Table. 1 we have
√
√
tan 43π = 3. However, tan−1 3 = π3 and not 43π . To overcome this problem, recall
that the tangent is π -periodic; that is, for all θ ,
tan θ = tan(θ + kπ )

(k = 0, ±1, ±2, . . .).

Since tan θ = xy , we conclude that

θ = tan−1

Fig. 1.17 Computing Arg z using (1.3.13).

For example, in Figure 1.17, the point z1 = 2 + 3 i lies in the first quadrant. Using
a calculator, we find Arg z1 = tan−1 23 ≈ 0.983. Also z2 = −2 − 3 i lies in the third
quadrant and Arg z2 = tan−1 23 − π ≈ −2.159. (All angles are measured in radians.)

Multiplication, Inverses, and Division in Polar Form
Let z1 = r1 (cos θ1 + i sin θ1 ) and z2 = r2 (cos θ2 + i sin θ2 ) be two nonzero complex
numbers. We compute their product directly, using i2 = −1:
z1 z2 = r1 (cos θ1 + i sin θ1 )r2 (cos θ2 + i sin θ2 )
= r1 r2 [(cos θ1 cos θ2 − sin θ1 sin θ2 ) + i(sin θ1 cos θ2 + cos θ1 sin θ2 )].

1.3 Polar Form

31

We recognize the trigonometric expressions as the sum angle formulas for the cosine
and sine:
cos(θ1 + θ2 ) = cos θ1 cos θ2 − sin θ1 sin θ2
and
sin(θ1 + θ2 ) = sin θ1 cos θ2 + cos θ1 sin θ2 .
Therefore, the polar form of the product is
z1 z2 = r1 r2 [cos(θ1 + θ2 ) + i sin(θ1 + θ2 )].

(1.3.15)

Taking the modulus of both sides of (1.3.15) we obtain
|z1 z2 | = r1 r2 ,

(1.3.16)

which is already known from Section 1.2. Examining the argument of both sides of
(1.3.15) we deduce
arg(z1 z2 ) = θ1 + θ2 = arg z1 + arg z2 .

(1.3.17)

More precisely, we have arg(z1 z2 ) = {θ1 + θ2 +2kπ : k = 0, ±1, ±2, . . .}. Identities
(1.3.16) and (1.3.17) tell us that when we multiply two complex numbers in polar
form, we multiply their moduli and add their arguments. See Figure 1.18.

Fig. 1.18 To multiply in polar
form, add the arguments and

Suppose that z1 = 0, and z2 = z−1
1 in (1.3.15). Since z1 z2 = z1 z1 = 1, we obtain

1 = r1 r2 [cos(θ1 + θ2 ) + i sin(θ1 + θ2 )].
Hence from (1.3.7), r1 r2 = 1 and θ1 + θ2 = 0, because the modulus of 1 is 1 and its
argument is 0. Hence r2 = r11 and θ2 = −θ1 . So the polar form of the inverse of a
complex number z is

De Moivre’s Identity
Multiplying the number z = 1(cos θ + i sin θ ) by itself, using (1.3.15), we obtain
z z = (1 · 1)[cos(θ + θ ) + i sin(θ + θ )] = cos 2θ + i sin 2θ .
Computing successive powers of z, a pattern emerges:
z = cos θ + i sin θ ,
z = cos 2θ + i sin 2θ ,
z3 = cos 3θ + i sin 3θ ,
..
.

More generally, we have the following useful identity.



1.3 Polar Form

33

Proposition 1.3.6. (De Moivre’s Identity) For a positive integer n and a real number θ we have
(1.3.20)
(cos θ + i sin θ )n = cos nθ + i sin nθ .
Proof. We prove (1.3.20) by mathematical induction. For n = 1, the statement is
true, since we have trivially (cos θ + i sin θ )1 = cos 1 · θ + i sin 1 · θ . Now for the
inductive step: We assume the statement is true for n, and prove that it is true for
n + 1. Let us compute
(cos θ + i sin θ )n+1 = (cos θ + i sin θ )n (cos θ + i sin θ )
= (cos nθ + i sin nθ )(cos θ + i sin θ )
= cos (n + 1)θ + i sin (n + 1)θ ,
where the second equality holds by the induction hypothesis and the third equality
is a consequence of (1.3.15). Thus (1.3.20) holds for n + 1 in place of n and thus it
holds for all positive integers n by mathematical induction.

We can use De Moivre’s identity to calculate powers of complex numbers of
arbitrary modulus r = 0. For if z = r(cos θ + i sin θ ), then
zn = [r(cos θ + i sin θ )]n
= rn (cos θ + i sin θ )n
= rn (cos nθ + i sin nθ ).

(1.3.21)

Example 1.3.7. (Polar Form and Powers) Calculate (2 + 2i)11 .
Solution. We use De Moivre’s identity for a quick calculation. First, write the number 2+2i in polar form: 2+2i = 23/2 (cos π4 +i sin π4 ). Then, from (1.3.21) we obtain

1 Complex Numbers and Functions

Example 1.3.8. (Double-angle identities) Use De Moivre’s identity with n = 2 to
derive the double-angle formulas for cos 2θ and sin 2θ .
Solution. From De Moivre’s identity with n = 2,
cos 2θ + i sin 2θ = (cos θ + i sin θ )2 = cos2 θ − sin2 θ + i 2 sin θ cos θ .
Equating real and imaginary parts, we get the double-angle formulas
cos 2θ = cos2 θ − sin2 θ

and

sin 2θ = 2 sin θ cos θ .

Roots of Complex Numbers
Definition 1.3.9. Let w = 0 be a complex number and n a positive integer. A number
z is called an nth root of w if zn = w.
De Moivre’s identity can in essence be worked “backwards” to find roots of
complex numbers. Let w = ρ (cos φ + i sin φ ) and z = r(cos θ + i sin θ ). In view
of (1.3.21), equation zn = w tells us that
rn (cos nθ + i sin nθ ) = ρ (cos φ + i sin φ ).

(1.3.22)

Two complex numbers are equal only if their moduli are equal, so rn = ρ . Thus,
take r = ρ 1/n (meaning the real root of a real number). Also, when two complex
numbers are equal, their arguments must differ by 2kπ , where k is an integer. So
nθ = φ + 2kπ ,

or

θ=

φ 2kπ

.
n
n

If we take the values k = 0, 1, . . . , n − 1, we get n values of θ that yield n distinct
roots of w. Any other value of k produces a root identical to one of these, since when
k increases by n, the argument of z increases by 2π . Thus we have a formula for the
n roots of a complex number w.
Proposition 1.3.10. Let w = ρ (cos φ + i sin φ ) = 0. The nth roots of w are the solutions of the equation zn = w. These are

Example 1.3.11. (Sixth roots of unity) Find and plot all numbers z such that z6 = 1.
What is the principal sixth root of 1?
Solution. The modulus of 1 is 1 and the argument of 1 is 0. According to (1.3.23),
the six roots have r = 11/6 = 1 and θ = 06 + k3π , for k = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Hence
the roots are

The principal root is clearly z1 = 1. We can list the roots explicitly, with the help of

z1 = 1, z2 = 12 + i 23√, z3 = − 12 +√i 23 ,
z4 = −1, z5 = − 12 − i 23 , z6 = 12 − i 23 .
The six roots are displayed in Figure 1.20.
Since they have the same modulus, they all
lie on the same circle centered at the origin.
They have a common angular separation of
π /3. This particular set of roots is symmetric about the x-axis because the polynomial
equation z6 = 1 has real coefficients, and
nonreal solutions come in conjugate pairs
(see Exercise 42 in Section 1.1).

Fig. 1.20 The sixth roots of
unity.

One may check directly that the sum of all sixth roots of unity in Example 1.3.11
equals 0. This interesting fact holds for all nth roots of unity. (See Exercise 63.)
Example 1.3.12. (Finding roots of complex numbers) Find and plot all numbers
z such that (z + 1)3 = 2 + 2i.
Solution. Change variables to w = z + 1. We must now solve w3 = 2 + 2i. The
polar form of 2 + 2i is 2 + 2i = 23/2 (cos π4 + i sin π4 ) and the equation becomes w3 =
23/2 (cos π4 + i sin π4 ).

As a final application, we revisit the quadratic equation

(a) Divide both sides of (1.3.27) by (z + 1)n (evidently, z + 1 cannot be zero) and conclude that
z
z+1 must be one of the nth roots of unity (see Exercise 61). Hence z = (z + 1)ωk , where ωk =
cos( 2knπ ) + i sin( 2knπ ), for k = 1, 2, . . . , n − 1. We must throw out k = 0 because z = z + 1 cannot

1.4 Complex Functions
A complex-valued function f of a complex variable is a relation that assigns to
each complex number z in a set S a unique complex number f (z). The set S is a
subset of the complex numbers and is called the domain of definition of f . The
unique complex number f (z) is called the value of f at z and is sometimes written
w = f (z). For example, the function f (z) = z3 assigns to each complex number z the
complex number w = z3 . When a function is given by a formula and the domain is
not specified, the domain is taken to be the largest set on which the formula makes
sense. For instance, the domain of f (z) = z3 is the set of all complex numbers C,
while the domain of g(z) = (z2 − 1)−1 is C \ {−1, 1}.
In calculus, a real-valued function y = g(x) of a real variable x was represented
as a graph in the (x, y)-plane. The graph provides a pictorial representation of the
function and its properties and contains vital information. To visualize a complex-

42

1 Complex Numbers and Functions

valued function z → f (z) unfortunately requires four dimensions: two dimensions
for the variable z and two for the values w = f (z). Since a four-dimensional picture
is not possible, we use two planes, the z-plane and the w-plane, and view the function
as a mapping from a subset of one plane to the other (see Figure 1.22). If we write
z = x + i y and w = u + i v, as a convention, the z-plane axes are labeled by x and y
and the w-plane axes by u and v. The image f [S] of a set S under a mapping f is
the set of all points w such that w = f (z) for some z in S. We illustrate the mapping
process with basic examples including some familiar geometric transformations.

Fig. 1.22 To visualize a mapping by a complex-valued function w = f (z), we
use two planes: the z-plane or (x, y)-plane for the domain of definition and the
w-plane or (u, v)-plane for the image.

Example 1.4.1. (Translation) Let S denote the disk S = {z : |z| ≤ 1}. Find the
image of S under the mapping f (z) = z + 2 + i.
Solution. For z in S, the number f (z) is found by adding z to 2 + i. If z is represented
by (x, y), then f (z) will be represented by (x + 2, y + 1). Hence the function translates the point z two units to the right and one unit up. The image of S, then, is the
set S translated two units to the right and one unit up (see Figure 1.23).


Fig. 1.23 A translation is a mapping of the form f (z) = z + b, where
b is a complex number. In Example 1.4.1, b = 2 + i. Consequently,
the image of the disk is a disk of the same radius, centered at 2+i (the
image of the original center). Hence, f [S] = {w : |w − 2 − i| ≤ 1}.

The next example deals with functions of the form f (z) = az, where a is a
nonzero complex constant. To understand these mappings, recall that when we

1.4 Complex Functions

43

multiply two complex numbers, we multiply their moduli and add their arguments. Writing a in polar form as a = r(cos θ + i sin θ ), we see that the mapping
z → r(cos θ + i sin θ )z multiplies the modulus of z by r > 0 (a dilation) and adds θ
to the argument of z (a rotation). Since multiplication is commutative, these operations of dilation and rotation may be applied in either order. When r = 1, we obtain
the mapping z → (cos θ + i sin θ )z, which is a rotation by the angle θ . Mappings of
the form z → rz, where r > 0, are called dilations by a factor r.
Example 1.4.2. (Dilations and rotations) Let S be the closed square of side length
2 with sides parallel to the axes centered at the point 2 (Figure 1.24).
(a) What is the image of S under the mapping f (z) = 3z?
(b) What is the image of S under the mapping f (z) = 2iz?
Solution. (a) For z in S the function f (z) = 3z has the effect of tripling the modulus
and leaving the argument unchanged. Hence f (z) lies on the ray extending from the
origin to z, at three times the distance from the origin to z. In particular, the image
of the square is another square whose corners are the images of the corners of the
original square.

Fig. 1.24 The images of the corners of S under f (z) = 3z are
f (1 + i) = 3 + 3i, f (1 − i) = 3 − 3i, f (3 + i) = 9 + 3i, f (3 − i) =
9 − 3i.

As seen from Figure 1.24, the image of S is a square of side length 6 centered at the
point 6 on the real axis.
(b) In polar form, we have i = cos π2 + i sin π2 , and so f (z) = 2(cos π2 + i sin π2 )z.

Fig. 1.25 The mapping f (z) = 2iz is a composition of two
mappings: a dilation by a factor of 2, followed by a counterclockwise rotation by an angle of π /2. The angle of rotation
is the argument of 2i.

44

1 Complex Numbers and Functions

Hence for z in S, f (z) has the effect of doubling the modulus and adding π2 to the
argument. To determine f [S], take the set S, dilate it by a factor of 2, then rotate it

counterclockwise by π /2 (Figure 1.25).
Examples 1.4.1 and 1.4.2 deal with mappings of the type f (z) = az + b, where a
and b are complex constants and a = 0. These are called linear transformations and
can always be thought of in terms of a dilation, a rotation, and a translation. These
transformations map regions to geometrically similar regions. It is important that
a = 0 because otherwise the transformation would be a constant. The transformation
f (z) = z is called the identity transformation for obvious reasons.
The next transformation is not linear.
Example 1.4.3. (Inversion) Find the image of the following sets under the mapping
f (z) = 1/z.
(a) S = {z : 0 < |z| < 1, 0 ≤ arg z ≤ π /2}.
(b) S = {z : 2 ≤ |z|, 0 ≤ arg z ≤ π }.
Solution. (a) We know from (1.3.18) that for z = r(cos θ + i sin θ ) = 0, we have
1 1
= (cos(−θ ) + i sin(−θ )).
z
r
According to this formula, the modulus of the number 1/z is the reciprocal of the
modulus of z and the argument of f (z) is the negative of the argument of z. Consequently, numbers inside the unit circle (|z| ≤ 1) get mapped to numbers outside the
1
≥ 1), and numbers in the upper half-plane get mapped to numbers in
unit circle ( |z|
the lower half-plane. Looking at S, as the modulus of z goes from 1 down to 0, the
modulus of f (z) goes from 1 up to infinity. As the argument of z goes from 0 up to
π /2, the argument of 1/z goes from 0 down to −π /2. Hence f [S] is the set of all
points in the fourth quadrant, including the border axes, that lie outside the unit
circle (see Figure 1.26):
f [S] = {w : 1 < |w|, −π /2 ≤ arg z ≤ 0}.

Fig. 1.26 The inversion w = 1z has the effect of inverting the
1
modulus and changing the sign of the argument, i.e., |w| = |z|
and Arg w = − Arg z.

(b) As the modulus of z increases from 2 up to infinity, the modulus of 1/z decreases
from 1/2 down to zero (but never equals zero). As the argument of z goes from 0 up
to π , the argument of 1/z goes from 0 down to −π .

Fig. 1.27 Under the inversion f (z) = 1z , points outside the circle
of radius 2, |z| ≥ 2, get mapped to points inside the circle of radius
1
1
2 , |w| ≤ 2 .

Hence f [S] is the set of nonzero points in the lower half-plane, including the real
axis, with 0 < |w| < 1/2 (see Figure 1.27):
f [S] = {w : 0 < |w| < 1/2, −π ≤ arg z ≤ 0}.
The function f (z) = 1/z in Example 1.4.3 is a special case of a general type of
mapping of the form
az + b
(ad = bc),
(1.4.1)
w=
cz + d
known as a linear fractional transformation or Möbius transformation. Here a,
b, c, d are complex numbers, and you can check that when ad = bc, w is constant.

Real and Imaginary Parts of Functions
For a complex function f , let u = Re f and v = Im f . The functions u and v are
real-valued functions, and we may think of them as functions of two real variables.
With a slight abuse of notation, we sometimes write u(z) = u(x + i y) = u(x, y), and
v(z) = v(x + i y) = v(x, y). Thus
f (z) = f (x + i y) = u(x, y) + i v(x, y).

(1.4.2)

For example, for f (z) = z2 = (x + i y)2 = x2 − y2 + 2ixy, we have
u(x, y) = x2 − y2

and

v(x, y) = 2xy.

As we illustrate in the sequel, the functions u(x, y) and v(x, y) may be used to determine algebraically the image of a set when the answer is not geometrically obvious.

Example 1.4.4. (Squaring) Let S be the vertical strip
S = {z = x + i y : 1 ≤ x ≤ 2}.
Find the image of S under the mapping f (z) = z2 .
Solution. As before, write
f (z) = z2 = x2 − y2 + i 2xy.
Thus the real part of f (z) is u(x, y) = x2 − y2 and the imaginary part of f (z) is
v(x, y) = 2xy. Let us fix 1 ≤ x0 ≤ 2, and find the image of the vertical line x = x0 .
A point (x0 , y) on the line maps to the point (u, v), where u = x02 − y2 , v = 2x0 y. To
determine the equation of the curve that is traced by the point (u, v) as y varies from
−∞ to ∞, we will eliminate y and get an algebraic relation between u and v. From
v = 2x0 y, we obtain y = 2xv0 . Plugging into the expression for u, we obtain
u = x02 −

v2
.
4x02

This gives u as a quadratic function of v. Hence the graph is a leftward-facing
parabola with a vertex at (u, v) = (x02 , 0) and v-intercepts at (0, ±2x02 ). As x0 ranges
from 1 up to 2, the corresponding parabolas in the w-plane sweep out a parabolic
region, as illustrated in Figure 1.28.

Fig. 1.28 For 1 ≤ x0 ≤ 2, the image of a line x = x0 under the
v2
mapping f (z) = z2 is a parabola u = x02 − 4x
2 . As we vary x0
0

from 1 to 2, these parabolas sweep out a parabolic region, which
determines f [S].

Since all points lie to the right of the parabola, where x0 = 1, and to the left of the
parabola, where x0 = 2, we have
f [S] = w = u + i v : 1 −

(b) Determine the image of the vertical strip S = {z = x + i y : a ≤ x ≤ b} under the

This is the equation of a circle in the w-plane, centered at ( 2x10 , 0), with radius 2x10
(Figure 1.29). The point (0, 0) is on the circle but is not part of the image of the line
x = x0 .

Mappings in Polar Coordinates
Some complex functions and regions are more naturally suited to polar coordinates.
In this case it may be advantageous to write z = r cos θ + i r sin θ and express w =
f (z) in polar coordinates as
w = ρ (cos φ + i sin φ ).
Then we identify the polar coordinates of w as functions of the polar coordinates
(r, θ ) of z:

ρ (r, θ ) = | f (r cos θ + i r sin θ )|

and

φ (r, θ ) = arg f (r cos θ + i r sin θ ) .

The next example uses such polar coordinates to track the mapping of circular sectors.
Example 1.4.6. (Mapping sectors) Let S be the sector

S = z : |z| ≤ , 0 ≤ arg z ≤
2
4
Find the image of S under the mapping f (z) = z3 .
Solution. If we write z = r(cos θ + i sin θ ), then z3 = r3 (cos 3θ + i sin 3θ ). Hence
the polar coordinates of w = f (z) = ρ (cos φ + i sin φ ) are ρ = r3 and φ = 3θ . As r
increases from 0 up to 32 , ρ increases from 0 up to 27
8 ; and, as θ goes from 0 up to
π

φ

Fig. 1.30 The mapping w = z3 has the effect of cubing the
norm and tripling the argument: |w| = |z|3 ; arg w = 3 Arg z.

Hence the image of S is the set of all w with modulus less than 27
8 and arguments
3π

3π
between 0 and 4 , i.e., f [S] = {w : |w| ≤ 8 , 0 ≤ arg w ≤ 4 } (see Figure 1.30). 
All the mappings considered in the examples have been one-to-one, in that distinct points z1 and z2 always map to distinct points f (z1 ) and f (z2 ). It is possible
that more than one point on the z-plane will map to the same point on the w-plane.
Such mappings are not one-to-one, and we are already familiar with some of them.

1.5 Sequences and Series of Complex Numbers
A sequence of complex numbers is a function whose domain of definition is the
set of positive integers {1, 2, . . . , n, . . .} and whose range is a subset of C. Thus
a sequence is an ordered list of complex numbers a(1), a(2), a(3), . . . , a(n), . . .. It
is customary to write an instead of a(n) and to denote the sequence by {an }∞
n=1 .
.
Sometimes we index a sequence by nonnegative integers, such as {an }∞
n=0
Many analytical expressions involving sequences of complex numbers look identical to those for real sequences. The difference is that, in the complex case, the
absolute value refers to distance in the plane, and sequences of complex numbers
can be thought of as sequences of points in the plane, which converge by eventually
staying inside small disks centered at the limit point (Figure 1.31).

Convergence of Sequences
We start by investigating the notions of convergence and divergence of complex
sequences.
Definition 1.5.1. We say that a sequence
{an }∞
n=1 converges to a complex number L
or has limit L as n tends to infinity, and write
lim an = L,

n→∞

if for every ε > 0 there is an integer N such
that
|an − L| < ε

for all n ≥ N.

If the sequence {an }∞
n=1 does not converge,
then we say that it diverges.

Fig. 1.31 A sequence {an }
converging to a complex number L.

1.5 Sequences and Series of Complex Numbers

53

If L = limn→∞ an , then we often use the notation an → L as n → ∞ or merely
an → L. It is immediate from the definition that a sequence an → L if and only if the
real sequence |an − L| → 0. For sequences that converge to zero, we have
lim an = 0

n→∞

⇔

lim |an | = 0.

n→∞

(1.5.1)

Proposition 1.5.2. If a limit of a complex sequence exists, then it is unique.
Proof. Indeed, if an → L and an → L with L = L, then for
1
ε = |L − L | > 0
2
there is N such that |an − L| < ε and |an − L | < ε for all n ≥ N. The triangle inequality gives |L − L | < 2ε , and this contradicts the choice of ε = |L − L |/2. Thus

we must have L = L .

Example 1.5.3. Determine whether or not the sequences an = 1n cos(n π4 )+i 1n sin(n π4 )
and bn = cos(n π4 ) + i(n π4 ) converge as n → ∞, and if they do, find their limits.

eight terms indefinitely. The first few terms

Definition 1.5.4. A sequence of complex numbers {an }∞
n=1 is said to be bounded if
there is a positive number M > 0 such that |an | ≤ M for all n.
The next theorem is proved as in the real case.

Theorem 1.5.8. Suppose that {zn }∞
n=1 is a sequence of complex numbers and write
zn = xn + i yn , where xn = Re zn and yn = Im zn . Then for x, y real numbers we have
lim zn = x + i y

n→∞

⇔

lim xn = x

n→∞

and

lim yn = y.

n→∞

Proof. Suppose that zn → x + i y. Then by Theorem 1.5.7 we have that zn → x + i y.
Using again Theorem 1.5.7 we obtain zn + zn → x + i y + x + i y = 2x and zn − zn →
x + i y − (x + i y) = 2iy. Thus 2xn → 2x and 2iyn → 2iy which implies that xn → x and
yn → y as n → ∞. Conversely, if xn → x and yn → y as n → ∞, then by Theorem 1.5.7

we have iyn → iy and adding yields xn + iyn → x + i y.
Next we show how to use the preceding results along with our knowledge of
real-valued sequences to compute limits of complex-valued sequences.
Example 1.5.9. (A useful limit) Show that

0 if |z| < 1,
lim zn =
1 if z = 1.
n→∞
Moreover, show that the limit does not exist for all other values of z; that is, if |z| > 1,
or |z| = 1 and z = 1, then limn→∞ zn does not exist.

Consequently, for a complex number |z| < 1, we have limn→∞ |z|n = 0. Since |z|n =
|zn |, we conclude from (1.5.1) that limn→∞ zn = 0. For |z| > 1, we have |z|n → ∞ as
n → ∞. Hence, by Theorem 1.5.5 the sequence {zn }∞
n=1 cannot converge because it
is not bounded. Now we deal with the case |z| = 1. If z = 1, the sequence {zn }∞
n=1 is
the constant sequence 1, which is trivially convergent. The case |z| = 1, z = 1 is not
as simple because the sequence, though bounded, does not converge. We will prove
that if this sequence converges, then z = 1. First note that if limn→∞ zn = L, then
|L| = | limn→∞ zn | = limn→∞ |z|n = 1, hence L = 0. Also, if zn → L, then zn+1 → L,
as n → ∞. But zn+1 = zn z, and by taking limits on both sides of this equality we
obtain L = Lz. Dividing by L (which is nonzero) we deduce z = 1, as claimed. 
Example 1.5.9 can be used to show that for θ not an integer multiple of π ,
limn→∞ cos nθ and limn→∞ sin nθ do not exist (Exercise 8).
We now introduce a fundamental concept, which is crucial in establishing convergence when the limit is not known.
Definition 1.5.10. A sequence {an }∞
n=1 is said to be a Cauchy sequence if for every
ε > 0 there is an integer N such that
|an − am | < ε

for all m, n ≥ N.

(1.5.2)

Thus the terms of a Cauchy sequence become arbitrarily close together. It is not
hard to see that a convergent sequence is a Cauchy sequence; this is because if the
terms are close to a limit, they must be close to each other.
The converse (that a Cauchy sequence converges) is also true and to prove it,
we appeal to the well-known fact that a Cauchy sequence of real numbers must
converge. This is a consequence of the completeness property of real numbers,
which states that if S is a nonempty subset of the real line with an upper bound M
(x ≤ M for all x in S), then S has a least upper bound b. That is, b is an upper bound
for S and if M is any other upper bound for S, then b ≤ M. The completeness property
is an axiom in the construction of the real number system, and it is equivalent to the
statement that all real Cauchy sequences are convergent.
Using this property of real numbers, we can prove a corresponding one for complex numbers.
Theorem 1.5.11. A sequence of complex numbers {an }∞
n=1 converges if and only if
it is a Cauchy sequence.
Proof. Suppose that {an }∞
n=1 converges to a limit L. Given ε > 0, let N be such
that n ≥ N implies |an − L| < ε2 . For m, n ≥ N, we have by the triangle inequality
(Figure 1.33):
|am − an | = |(am − L) + (L − an )| ≤ |am − L| + |L − an | <

ε ε
+ = ε.

Hence {an }∞
n=1 is a Cauchy sequence.
Conversely, suppose that {an }∞
n=1 is a
Cauchy sequence. Then for given ε > 0
there is an N such that |an − am | < ε for
all m, n ≥ N. Write an = xn + i yn , where
xn , yn are real. The inequalities | Re z| ≤ |z|
and | Im z| ≤ |z| imply that |xn − xm | ≤
|an − am | < ε and |yn − ym | ≤ |an − am | <
ε , which in turn implies that {xn } and
{yn } are Cauchy sequences of real numbers. By the completeness property of real
∞
numbers, {xn }∞
n=1 and {yn }n=1 are convergent sequences.

Fig. 1.33 If both |am − L| < ε2 and
|an − L| < ε2 hold, then |am − an | < ε .

Hence {an }∞
n=1 is convergent by Theorem 1.5.8.

Complex Series

∑ an ,

Definition 1.5.12. We say that a series ∑∞
n=0 an converges, or is convergent, to a
complex number s, and we write s = ∑∞
n=0 an , if the sequence of partial sums converges to s, i.e., if lim sn = s. Otherwise, we say that the series ∑∞
n=0 an diverges or
n→∞
is divergent.

1.5 Sequences and Series of Complex Numbers

57

So in order to establish the convergence or divergence of a series, we must study the
behavior of the sequence of partial sums.

n=0 z converges and

∑ zn = 1 − z .

n=0

Show that the series diverges for all other values of z.

Solution. Consider the partial sum (a
typical case is shown in Figure 1.34):
sn = 1 + z + z 2 + · · · + zn .
We multiply by z and add 1 to obtain
1 + zsn = 1 + z + z2 + z3 + · · · + zn+1
which is equal to sn + zn+1 . If z = 1, we
solve for sn to find

sn =

To get a partial sum sn , add the
vectors 1, z, . . . , zn .

From Example 1.5.9, the sequence {zn+1 }∞
n=0 converges to 0 if |z| < 1 and di1
verges if |z| > 1 or |z| = 1 and z = 1. This implies that {sn }∞
n=0 converges to 1−z if
|z| < 1 and diverges for all other values of z, which is what we wanted to show. 
Geometric series may appear in disguise. Basically, whenever you see a series of
n
the form ∑∞
n=0 w you should be able to use the geometric series to sum it. However,
you have to be careful with the region of convergence.

Solution. This is a geometric series of the form ∑∞
n=0 w where w =

4+2z .

This series converges to 1−w
if and only if
|w| < 1. Expressing these results in terms
of z, we find that the series converges to

if and only if


 1 


 4 + 2z  < 1

⇔

1 < |4 + 2z|.

To better understand the region of convergence, we write the inequality using expressions of the form |z − z0 | and interpret
the latter as a distance in the usual way.

Fig. 1.35 The shaded region describes all z such that 12 < |z + 2|.
These are the points where the series in Example 4 converges.

We have
1 < |4 + 2z|

⇔

1
< |2 + z|
2

⇔

1
< |z − (−2)|.
2

This describes the set of all z whose distance to −2 is strictly larger than 12 . Thus
the series converges outside the closed disk shown in Figure 1.35, with center at −2

and radius 12 .

Properties of Series and Tests of Convergence
Finding a closed expression for the partial sums of a series, as for geometric series, is
rather rare and in many cases not possible. Therefore, we have to rely on properties
of series to establish their convergence or divergence. Because a series is really
a sequence of partial sums, all of the results about sequences can be restated for
series. For convenience and ease of reference, we state some of these results along
with several tests of convergence that are similar to ones for real series. The proofs
are omitted in most cases.

Theorem 1.5.17. (The nth Term Test for Divergence) If ∑∞
n=0 an is convergent,
then lim an = 0. Equivalently, if limn→∞ an = 0 or limn→∞ an does not exist, then
n→∞
∑∞
n=0 an diverges.
Proof. Let sn = ∑nm=0 am . If sn → s, then also sn−1 → s, and so sn − sn−1 → s − s = 0.
But sn − sn−1 = an , and so an → 0.

Applying the nth term test, we see right away that the geometric series ∑∞
n=0 z is
divergent if |z| = 1 or |z| > 1.
∞
For m ≥ 1, the expression tm = ∑∞
n=m+1 an is called a tail of the series ∑n=0 an .
For fixed m, the tail tm is itself a series, which differs from the original series by
finitely many terms. So it is obvious that a series converges if and only if all its tails
converge. As m → ∞, we are dropping more and more terms from the tail series; as
a result, we have the following useful fact.
∞
Proposition 1.5.18. If ∑∞
n=0 an is convergent, then limm→∞ ∑n=m+1 an = 0. Hence if
a series converges, then its tail tends to 0.

Proof. Let s = ∑∞

A well-known consequence of the completeness property of real numbers is that
every bounded monotonic sequence (increasing or decreasing) converges. Since
the partial sums of a series with nonnegative terms are increasing, we conclude
that if these partial sums are bounded, then the series is convergent. Thus, if for a
complex series we have ∑Nn=1 |an | ≤ M for all N, then the series ∑∞
n=1 an is absolutely
convergent.
Recall that, for series with real terms, absolute convergence implies convergence.
The same is true for complex series.

Proof. Let sn = a0 + a1 + · · · + an and vn = |a0 | + |a1 | + · · · + |an |. By Theorem 1.5.11, it is enough to show that the sequence of partial sums {sn }∞

Since ∑∞
n=0 |an | converges, the sequence {vn }n=0 converges and hence it is Cauchy.
Thus, given ε > 0 we can find N so that, vn − vm < ε for n > m ≥ N, implying that

|sn − sm | < ε for n > m ≥ N. Hence {sn }∞
n=0 is a Cauchy sequence.

For a complex series ∑∞
n=0 an , consider the series ∑n=0 |an | whose terms are real

of convergence for series with nonnegative terms can be used to test the (absolute)
convergence of complex series. We list a few such convergence theorems.

form a j bk , where j and k range over

an array as shown in Figure 1.37.
The nth term of a Cauchy product:
a0 bn + a1 bn−1 + · · · + an−1 b1 + an b0
= ∑nj=0 a j bn− j = cn . By summing all
the cn ’s, we pick up all the terms of
form a j bk , but in a very special order: (a0 b0 ) + (a1 b0 + a1 b1 ) + · · · .

Fig. 1.37 In the array a j bk , the cn ’s is obtained by
summing the terms along the shown slanted lines.

The term cn in the Cauchy product is obtained by summing terms a j bk along the
diagonal j + k = n, as shown in Figure 1.37. If we sum over all the diagonals, as
prescribed by the Cauchy product, we eventually collect all the terms a j bk . Does
the Cauchy product series converge to the ordinary product of the two series (where
we just multiply two complex numbers)? If the two series are absolutely convergent,
the answer is yes.

right are all the terms in the (n + 1) × (n + 1)-array (see Figure 1.37). The second
inequality follows since for series with nonnegative terms, a partial sum is smaller
than the sum of all terms. Hence the partial sums of ∑∞

the series converges in view of Theorem 1.5.20. Next we show that sn = ∑nk=0 cn

Looking for an extension of the exponential function ex (x ∈ R) to the complex
plane, we wonder whether we are able to substitute x with a complex number z in
(1.6.1). Note that the series in (1.6.1) converges absolutely by an easy application
of the ratio test (Example 1.5.24). Consequently, for a complex z we have

where the last equality is a consequence of the binomial identity (Exercise 65 in
Section 1.3). Now the left-hand side of (1.6.6) is ez ew , but, in view of (1.6.7), the
right-hand side is ez+w , hence (1.6.3) holds.
Now (1.6.4) is a consequence of (1.6.3) and of the fact that e0 = 1 since
1 = ez−z = ez e−z .

66

It follows from this that ez is never zero and that its reciprocal is e−z . Finally (1.6.5)

Note that the exponential function reduces to the familiar function ex when z in

Euler’s identity has many important applications that we will explore in this text.
Let us use it to express ez in terms of familiar functions. Write z = x + i y, where x
and y are real. By (1.6.3), we have
ez = ex+i y = ex eiy ,
and, by Euler’s identity, eiy = cos y + i sin y. Putting this together, we obtain the
desired expression of ez in terms of the basic functions: ex , cos x, and sin x.

Corollary 1.6.4. For z = x + i y, with x, y real, we have
ez = ex (cos y + i sin y) = ex cos y + i ex sin y.

(1.6.9)

Taking real and imaginary parts in (1.6.9), we find
Re (ez ) = ex cos y

and

Im (ez ) = ex sin y.

Example 1.6.5 shows that the complex exponential function can take on negative
real values (part (a)) and complex values (parts (b)–(d)) as opposed to the real exponential function, ex , which is always positive. Also, in contrast with ex , ez is not
one-to-one, as illustrated by parts (a) and (e) of Example 1.6.5.

68

1 Complex Numbers and Functions

Looking back at (1.6.9) and using the
fact that ex > 0 for all x, it follows immediately that (1.6.9) is the polar form, as in
(1.3.3), of ez .
Next, we make some remarks about the
modulus and the argument of the exponential function. It follows from the polar
form of the exponential that for z = x + i y,
the modulus of ez is ex and the argument
of ez is y. This is displayed in Figure 1.38.
Consequently, ez is never zero. Moreover,
y + 2kπ is also an argument of ez for an
integer k. We summarize these facts:

Fig. 1.38 The modulus and argument of ez .

|ez | = ex > 0
and the argument of

ez

(1.6.11)

is

arg(ez ) = y + 2kπ

(k an integer).

(1.6.12)

Example 1.6.6. Compute |ez | and Arg (ez ) for the following values of z .
(a) 1 + i

(b) −1 − 6i

(c) i π2

(d) −π

|ez |.

Solution. In all cases, we use (1.6.11) to compute
We use (1.6.12) to compute
arg(ez ) and then, by adding an integer multiple of 2π , we find the value of arg(ez )
that lies in the interval (−π , π ], which is Arg (ez )
(a) z = 1+i, ez = e1+i = eei = e(cos 1+i sin 1). Thus |e1+i | = e, arg(e1+i ) = 1+2kπ .
Since 1 is in the interval (−π , π ], we also have Arg (e1+i ) = 1.
(b) z = −1 − 6i, ez = e−1−6i = e−1 e−6i = e(cos(−6) + i sin(−6)). Thus |e−1−6i | =
e−1 , arg(e−1−6i ) = −6 + 2kπ . Now −6 is not in the interval (−π , π ], but −6 + π is
in this interval; so Arg (e−1−6i ) = −6 + 2π .
π

π

π

(c) z = i π2 , ez = ei 2 = cos( π2 ) + i sin( π2 )) = i. Thus |ei 2 | = e0 = 1, arg(ei 2 ) =
π
2kπ ; Arg (ei 2 ) = π2 .

π
2

+

(d) In this case, z is real and so ez is real and positive: ez = e−π > 0. Thus |e−π | =

e−π ; arg(e−π ) = 0 + 2kπ ; and so Arg (e−π ) = 0.
We observed following Example 1.6.5 that ez is not one-to-one. In fact, let us call
a complex-valued function f (z) periodic with period τ = 0 if for all z in the domain
of definition of f , we have f (z + τ ) = f (z) . For all complex numbers z,
ez+2π i = ez e2π i = ez (cos(2π ) + i sin(2π )) = ez .
Hence the exponential function ez is periodic with period 2π i.

(1.6.13)

1.6 The Complex Exponential

69

Proposition 1.6.7. We have
ez = 1

if and only if

z = 2kπ i for some integer k.

(1.6.14)

Also,
ez1 = ez2

if and only if

z1 = z2 + 2kπ i for some integer k.

(1.6.15)

Proof. Since ez = ex cos y + iex sin y, equating real and imaginary parts, we find
1 = ez ⇔ 1 = ex cos y + iex sin y ⇔ 1 = ex cos y and ex sin y = 0.
Since ex > 0, if we have ex sin y = 0, then sin y = 0 which implies that y = l π for
some integer l. Hence cos y = cos(l π ) = (−1)l and so 1 = ex cos y = ex (−1)l . It
follows that l must be an even integer, say l = 2k. Then 1 = ex (−1)2k , hence x =
0. This establishes the difficult direction in (1.6.14). To prove (1.6.15), notice that
ez1 = ez2 ⇔ ez1 −z2 = 1, which by (1.6.14) holds if and only if z1 − z2 = 2kπ i or

z1 = z2 + 2kπ i for some integer k.

Exponential and Polar Representations
Euler’s identity (1.6.8) provides yet another convenient way to represent complex
numbers. Indeed, if z = r(cos θ + i sin θ ) is a complex number in polar form, then,
since eiθ = cos θ + i sin θ , we obtain the exponential representation or polar form
z = reiθ . From this representation it is clear that
|z| = 1 ⇔ r = 1 ⇔ z = eiθ ,

arg z = θ .

Thus the complex numbers eiθ , θ real,
are exactly the unimodular complex numbers. Because their distance to the origin
always equals 1, all complex numbers of
the form eiθ lie on the unit circle. All
other nonzero complex numbers are positive multiples of some eiθ . This fact is
illustrated in Figure 1.39, where the ray
from the origin to z = reiθ intersects the
unit circle at the point eiθ . Hence, to plot a
point in exponential notation z = reiθ , we
move a distance r along the ray extending
Fig. 1.39 Plotting z = reiθ .
from the origin to eiθ .
Many operations on complex numbers are simplified by using the exponential
notation, z = r ei θ .

(1.6.17), we have
z = r(cos θ + i sin θ ) = r(cos θ − i sin θ ) = r(cos(−θ ) + i sin(−θ )) = re−i θ .
To prove (1.6.18), write z = r ei θ with r = 0. Then

Multiplication and division of unimodular numbers are particularly
easy via the complex exponential. Indeed, if z1 = eiθ1 and z2 = eiθ2 , then
from (1.6.19) and (1.6.20) we obtain
z1 z2 = eiθ1 eiθ2 = ei(θ1 +θ2 )
z1

Thus to multiply two unimodular

The Exponential as a Mapping
Equation (1.6.12) has as a consequence that the argument of ez is equal to the imaginary part of z. Because of this property, we expect the exponential function to map
line segments to circular arcs and rectangular regions to circular regions. We illustrate these ideas with an example.
Example 1.6.11. (An exponential mapping) Consider the rectangular area
S = {z = x + i y : −1 ≤ x ≤ 1, 0 ≤ y ≤ π }.
Find the image of S under the mapping f (z) = ez .

1.6 The Complex Exponential

73

Fig. 1.41 We denote the image of a point P in the xy-plane by the point P
in the uv-plane. The mapping w = ez takes the vertical line segment EF to a
semicircle in the uv-plane with u-intercepts at E  and F  .

Solution. Fix x0 in the interval [−1, 1] and consider EF, the vertical line segment
x = x0 inside S. Points on the segment EF are of the form z = x0 + i y, where 0 ≤
y ≤ π . For such z,
f (z) = ez = ex0 eiy = ex0 (cos y + i sin y).
The point w = ex0 eiy has modulus ex0 and argument y. In particular, w lies on the
circle of radius ex0 with center at 0. As y varies from 0 to π , the point w traces the
upper semicircle. Thus ez maps the line segment EF to the upper semicircle with
center at 0 and radius ex0 .
Now, as we vary x0 from −1 to 1, ex0 varies from e−1 to e. As a consequence, the
corresponding semicircles increase in radius and fill the semi-annular area between
the semicircle of radius e−1 with center at 0 and the semicircle of radius e with
center at 0 (Figure 1.41).

1.7 Trigonometric and Hyperbolic Functions
In this section we extend the definitions of the trigonometric and hyperbolic functions from real numbers to complex numbers. As in the previous section, we could

76

1 Complex Numbers and Functions

define these functions using convergent series expressions, but it also convenient to
actually define them in terms of the complex exponential function.

Trigonometric Functions
To relate the trigonometric functions to the exponential function, recall Euler’s
identity
eiθ = cos θ + i sin θ
where θ is a real number. Replacing θ by −θ we obtain
e−iθ = cos θ − i sin θ .
Adding these two identities and dividing by 2, we deduce
cos θ =

eiθ + e−iθ
.
2

(1.7.1)

Similarly, subtracting and dividing by 2i, we get
sin θ =

eiθ − e−iθ
.
2i

(1.7.2)

Since the right side of each identity involves the exponential function, which we
have already extended to complex numbers, we may use (1.7.1) and (1.7.2) to define
the complex cosine and sine functions for all complex numbers z.
Definition 1.7.1. For a complex number z, we set
cos z =

eiz + e−iz
2

(1.7.3)

sin z =

eiz − e−iz

and

These are new functions, even though they are named after familiar functions;
they share some similar properties with the usual cosine and sine functions but also
differ in many respects.

Example 1.7.2. Compute (a) cos(2 + i π ) and (b) sin(i 54π ).
Solution. We use the definitions. For (a), we have from (1.7.3),

The appearance of the hyperbolic functions in the expressions of the real and imaginary parts of the complex cosine and sine functions was not a coincidence. In fact,
general formulas of this nature are derived later in this section.

A function f (z) is said to be even if f (z) = f (−z) and odd if f (−z) = − f (z),
for all z in the complex plane. We can show from their definitions that the cosine is
even while the sine is odd; also, both of them are 2π -periodic. In fact, the complex
trigonometric functions satisfy many identities that we are familiar with for real
trigonometric functions.
Proposition 1.7.3. (Properties of Trigonometric Functions) The following identities are valid for a complex number z:
cos(−z) = cos z
cos(z + 2π ) = cos z

sin(−z) = − sin z
sin(z + 2π ) = sin z

(1.7.5)
(1.7.6)

sin(z + π2 ) = cos z
cos(z + π2 ) = − sin z
eiz = cos z + i sin z

(1.7.7)
(1.7.8)

cos2 z + sin2 z = 1 .

(1.7.9)

eiz + e−iz
ei(−z) + e−i(−z)

We recognize (1.7.8) as Euler’s identity (1.6.8), in which the real argument θ is
replaced by a complex argument z. The second identities in (1.7.5), (1.7.6), and
(1.7.7) are proved similarly. Next, to prove (1.7.8), we multiply (1.7.4) by i and add
the resulting identity to (1.7.3).
Identity (1.7.9) is the analog of the famous Pythagorean identity relating the real
cosine and sine functions. Using (1.7.8), we have

The familiar angle-addition and half-angle formulas also apply to the complex
cosine and sine.
Proposition 1.7.4. (Trigonometric Identities) Let z, z1 , z2 be complex numbers.
Then we have
cos(z1 + z2 ) = cos z1 cos z2 − sin z1 sin z2 ;
sin(z1 + z2 ) = sin z1 cos z2 + cos z1 sin z2 ;

,
4
which is the same as cos(z1 + z2 ). The proof of (1.7.11) is similar. Now, setting
z1 = z2 = z in (1.7.10) yields
cos 2z = cos2 z − sin2 z.
Replacing sin2 z by 1 − cos2 z, we obtain (1.7.12). Replacing cos2 z by 1 − sin2 z, we
deduce (1.7.13).


1.7 Trigonometric and Hyperbolic Functions

Up to this point the properties of the complex trigonometric functions have been
similar to those of the real trigonometric functions. But there are some differences.
Taking z = iy in (1.7.3), where y is a real number, we obtain
cos(iy) =

ey + e−y
ei(iy) + e−i(iy)
=
= cosh y.
2
2

(1.7.14)

Similarly, inserting z = iy in (1.7.4), we obtain
sin(iy) =

ei(iy) − e−i(iy)
ey − e−y
=i
= i sinh y.
2i
2

(1.7.15)

It follows from these identities that the complex cosine and sine function are unbounded functions. This should be contrasted with the fact that | cos x| ≤ 1 and
| sin x| ≤ 1 for all x (real).

Example 1.7.5. Show that cos z and sin z are not bounded functions.
Solution. Take z = iy, where y is real. Then, from (1.7.14), | cos z| = | cos iy| = cosh y.
Since cosh y → ∞ as y → ±∞, we see that | cos z| cannot be bounded by a finite
number; hence cos z is not a bounded function. Similarly, using (1.7.15), we have
| sin iy| = |i sinh y| = | sinh y|, and since | sinh y| → ∞ as y → ±∞, it follows that sin z
is not a bounded function.

The connection between the complex trigonometric functions and the real hyperbolic functions becomes more explicit once we compute the real and imaginary
parts of cos z and sin z.
Proposition 1.7.6. Let z = x + i y be a complex number (x, y real). Then we have
cos z = cos x cosh y − i sin x sinh y

(1.7.16)

sin z = sin x cosh y + i cos x sinh y

| cos z| = cos2 x + sinh2 y

| sin z| = sin2 x + sinh2 y.

(1.7.17)
(1.7.18)
(1.7.19)

Proof. To prove (1.7.16), we appeal to (1.7.10) and (1.7.14)–(1.7.15) and write
cos z = cos(x + i y)
= cos x cos(iy) − sin x sin(iy)
= cos x cosh y − i sin x sinh y .
The proof of (1.7.17) is similar. To prove (1.7.18), we use (1.7.16) and (1.2.1). We
also use the identity cosh2 y − sinh2 y = 1 for real hyperbolic functions:

80

1 Complex Numbers and Functions

| cos z|2 = cos2 x cosh2 y + sin2 x sinh2 y
= cos2 x (1 + sinh2 y) + sin2 x sinh2 y
= cos2 x + sinh2 y(cos2 x + sin2 x)
= cos2 x + sinh2 y.


The proof of (1.7.19) is similar and is left as an exercise.

Example 1.7.7. (Zeros of the sine and cosine functions)
(a) Show that sin z = 0 ⇔ z = kπ , for some integer k.
(b) Show cos z = 0 ⇔ z = π2 + kπ , for some integer k.
Thus cos z and sin z have the same zeros as their real counterparts, cos x and sin x.
Solution. (a) Suppose that sin z = 0; then | sin z| = 0, and so by (1.7.19), we have
sin x = 0 and sinh y = 0. The real function sinh y equals zero ⇔ y = 0, and the real
function sin x equals zero ⇔ x = kπ for some integer k. Hence (a) holds.
(b) Knowing the zeros of the sine, we find the zeros of the cosine using (1.7.7). We
have cos z = 0 if and only if sin z + π2 = 0. This happens exactly when z + π2 = kπ
for some integer k or equivalently when z = − π2 + kπ for some integer k. Replacing
k by k + 1, we deduce (b).

Next we study certain images under the mapping w = sin z.

sin z of the semi-infinite strip
!
π
π
S = z = x+iy : − ≤ x ≤ , y ≥ 0 .
2
2
Solution. As in previous examples of mappings, we first find the image under f of a
simple curve in the domain of definition, often a line segment or line. Then we sweep
the domain of definition with this curve and keep track of the area swept by the
image. Fix 0 ≤ y0 < ∞ and consider the horizontal line segment defined by: y = y0 ,
− π2 ≤ x ≤ π2 . Let u + i v denote the image of a point z = x + i y0 on this line segment.
Using (1.7.17), we get u + i v = sin(x + i y0 ) = sin x cosh y0 + i cos x sinh y0 . Hence
u = sin x cosh y0 and v = cos x sinh y0 . If y0 = 0, we see that v = 0 and u = sin x,
which shows that the image of the interval − π2 ≤ x ≤ π2 under the mapping sin z is
the interval −1 ≤ u ≤ 1. The case y0 > 0 is more interesting. In this case, we have
u
= sin x
cosh y0

and

v
= cos x.
sinh y0

Note that v ≥ 0 because cos x ≥ 0 for − π2 ≤ x ≤
(1.7.20) then adding them, we get

The u-intercepts of the ellipse are at u = ± cosh y0 and the v-intercept is at v =
sinh y0 . As y0 → ∞, cosh y0 and sinh y0 tend to ∞. And as y0 → 0, sinh y0 → 0 and
cosh y0 → 1. So, as y0 varies in the interval 0 < y0 < ∞, the upper semi-ellipses fill
the upper half w-plane v ≥ 0, including the u-axis (Figure 1.42).

Fig. 1.42 The mapping w = sin z takes the horizontal line segment y =

One can verify (Exercise 23) that the boundary of S is mapped to the boundary
of f [S], namely the u-axis.

the cosine and sine in accordance with the real definitions.

tan z1 = tan z2 ⇔

where the step before last follows from Example 1.7.7(a).

The real hyperbolic functions have complex extensions as well.

1 Complex Numbers and Functions

1.8 Logarithms and Powers
In this section we define complex logarithms and complex powers of complex numbers. This enables us to compute expressions like Log i and ii .
The logarithm was defined in elementary algebra as the inverse of the exponential
function. We follow this idea to define the complex logarithm, log z for z = 0. However, we expect to encounter some difficulties here because the exponential function
ez is not one-to-one. To define the complex function w = log z, set
w = log z

⇔

ew = z.

(1.8.1)

To determine w in terms of z, write w = u + i v and z = r eiθ , with |z| = r > 0 and
θ = arg z. Then (1.8.1) becomes
eu+iv = eu eiv = z = reiθ ,
and hence
eu = r

and

eiv = eiθ .

(1.8.2)

The first equation gives u = ln r, where here ln r denotes the usual natural logarithm
of the positive number r. The second equation in (1.8.2) tells us that v and θ differ
by an integer multiple of 2π , because the complex exponential is 2π i periodic. So
v = θ + 2kπ , where k is an integer, or simply v = arg z. Putting this together, we
obtain the formula for the complex logarithm:
log z = ln |z| + i arg z

(z = 0).

(1.8.3)

Unlike the real logarithm, this formula defines a multi-valued function, because
arg z takes multiple values. The complex logarithm is not a function in the standard
sense, since functions assign a unique value to each variable.
Example 1.8.1. (Computing logarithms) Evaluate the following logarithms:
(a) log i
(b) log(1 + i)
(c) log(−2).
π

Solution. (a) The polar form of i is i = ei 2 . So |i| = 1 and arg i =

(c) We have
| − 2| = 2, arg(−2) = π + 2kπ ⇒ log(−2) = ln 2 + i(π + 2kπ ) = ln 2 + (2k + 1)π i .
More explicitly, log(−2) consists of the following complex values:
ln 2 + π i, ln 2 − π i, ln 2 + 3π i, ln 2 − 3π i, ln 2 ± 5π i, . . . .
Note that all values of log(−2) have identical real parts and their imaginary parts
differ by integer multiples of 2π i. These observations are true in general.

It is clear from Example 1.8.1 and from the definition of log z that to make log z
single-valued, and hence turn it into a function, it is enough to define a single-valued
version of arg z. For example, we can use the principal value of the argument, Arg z
(see Definition 1.3.2) which satisfies −π < Arg z ≤ π .
Definition 1.8.2. The principal value or principal branch of the complex logarithm is defined by
Log z = ln |z| + i Arg z
(z = 0).
(1.8.4)
Thus Log z is the (particular) value of log z whose imaginary part is in the interval
(−π , π ]. Because arg z = Arg z + 2kπ , where k is an integer, we see from (1.8.3) and
(1.8.4) that all the values of log z differ from the principal value by 2kπ i. Thus
log z = Log z + 2kπ i

(z = 0).

(1.8.5)

Example 1.8.3. (Principal values of the logarithm) Compute the expressions
(a) Log i
(b) Log (1 + i)
(c) Log (−i)
(d) Log 5
(e) Log (e6π i ).
Solution. If we know log z, to find Log z, it suffices to choose the value of log z with
imaginary part that lies in the interval (−π , π ]. If we do not know log z, we compute
Log z using (1.8.4). Appealing to Example 1.8.1, we have for (a) Log i = i π2 ; and
for (b) Log (1 + i) = Log (1 + i) = 12 ln 2 + i π4 . For (c), we use (1.8.4):
| − i| = 1, Arg (−i) = −

π

⇒ Log (−i) = ln(1) − i = −i .

For (d), we use (1.8.4):
|5| = 5, Arg 5 = 0 ⇒ Log 5 = ln 5.
For (e), we use (1.8.4) and note that e6π i is a unimodular number. In fact e6π i = 1.
So
|e6π i | = 1, Arg (e6π i ) = 0 ⇒ Log (e6π i ) = ln 1 = 0.
A few observations are in order to highlight some similarities and differences
between the natural logarithm and the complex logarithm.

1 Complex Numbers and Functions

• If x is a positive real number, then Log x = ln x.
• If x is a negative real number, then Log x = ln |x| + iπ .
• For all z, the identity e Log z = z is true. But, as illustrated by Example 1.8.3(e),
Log (ez ) is not always equal to z. In fact, Log (ez ) = z ⇔ −π < Im z ≤ π .
• Many algebraic properties of ln x no longer hold for Log z. For example, the
identity ln(x1 x2 ) = ln x1 + ln x2 , which holds for all positive real numbers x1 and
x2 , does not hold for Log z. Consider the following:
Log (−1)(−1) = Log (1) = 0 = Log (−1) + Log (−1),
since Log (−1) = iπ .

Branches of the argument and the logarithm
As we may imagine, we could have specified a different range of values of arg z in
defining a logarithmic function in terms of (1.8.3). In fact, for every real number
α we can specify that α < arg z ≤ α + 2π . This selection assigns a single value to
arg z, denoted by argα z, that lies in the interval (α , α + 2π ].
Definition 1.8.4. Let α be a fixed real number. For z = 0, we call the unique value
of arg z that falls in the interval (α , α + 2π ] the α -th branch of arg z and we denote
it by argα z. Precisely, we define the α -th branch of log z by the identity
logα z = ln |z| + i argα z,

where α < argα z ≤ α + 2π .

(1.8.6)

The ray through the origin along which a branch of the logarithm is discontinuous
is called a branch cut.
When α = −π , this definition leads to the principal value of the logarithm; that
is, log−π z = Log z.
Since two values of arg z differ by an integer multiple of 2π , it follows that, for a
complex number z = 0 and real numbers α and β , there is an integer k (depending
on z, α , and β ), such
n logα z = logβ z + 2kπ i .

Example 1.8.5. (Different branches of the logarithm) Evaluate
(b) log π i
(c) log π (−2)
(a) log0 i
2

Solution. If we know log z, to find logα z, it suffices to choose the value of log z
with imaginary part that lies in the interval (α , α + 2π ]. If we do not know log z, we
compute logα z using (1.8.6).
(a) We have α = 0 and so the imaginary part of log0 z, arg0 z, must be in the interval
(0, 2π ]. From Example 1.8.1, log i = i π2 +2kπ i; and so log0 i = i π2 . Note that Log i =
log0 i.

1.8 Logarithms and Powers

(b) We have α = π2 , so arg π z belongs to the interval ( π2 ,

arg π i =

Hence

(and not π2 ). Consequently, log π i = i 52π . Note that Log i = log π i + 2π . (c) Reason2
2
ing as in (b), we find that arg π (−2) = π , because this value of arg(−2) does lie in
the interval ( π2 ,

So
log π (−2) = ln 2 + i arg π (−2) = ln 2 + iπ

Note that Log (−2) = log π (−2).

The Logarithm as a Map
In studying mapping properties of the logarithm, we recall that the exponential function maps rectangular regions to circular regions. Here we expect the logarithm to
do the opposite, namely to map circular regions to rectangular regions.
Example 1.8.6. (The map Log z) Let 0 < a < b and 0 ≤ α1 < α2 ≤ π . Find the
image of the circular region S = {z : a ≤ |z| ≤ b, α1 ≤ Arg z ≤ α2 } under the
mapping f (z) = Log z.
Solution. The region S is bounded by the rays at angle 0 ≤ α1 and α2 ≤ π , and the
circular arcs with radii a and b, as shown in Figure 1.43.

Fig. 1.43 Log z is a one-to-one mapping of the circular region onto a rectangle. The boundary of the circular region is
mapped onto the boundary of the rectangle as follows: side # j
in the domain is mapped to side # j in the range.

Consider a line segment L on the ray at angle α , where α1 ≤ α ≤ α2 . For z on
this ray, we have Arg z = α and so Log z = ln |z| + i Arg z = ln |z| + iα . As |z| varies
from a to b, ln |z| varies from ln a to ln b, and thus Log z describes the horizontal line
segment u + iα , where ln a ≤ u ≤ ln b. By letting α vary from α1 to α2 , L sweeps
S and the image of L sweeps the rectangular area with vertices (ln a, α1 ), (ln b, α1 ),

(ln b, α2 ) and (ln a, α2 ), as shown in Figure 1.43.

1 Complex Numbers and Functions

Complex Powers
In analogy with calculus, for a complex number z = 0, we define the complex power
za = ea log z

(z = 0),

(1.8.7)

where log z is the complex logarithm (1.8.3). Since log z is multi-valued, it follows
from (1.8.7) that za is in general multi-valued. By specifying a branch of the logarithm, we obtain a single-valued branch of the complex power function from
(1.8.7). In particular, if we choose the principal logarithm (1.8.4), we obtain the
principal value of za :
(z = 0).
(1.8.8)
za = ea Log z

Example 1.8.7. (Evaluating complex powers) Compute (−i)1+i using (a) the principal branch of the logarithm; (b) the branch of the logarithm with a branch cut at
angle α = 0.

(−i)1+i = e(1+i) log0 (−i) = e(1+i)

which is a different value from the one we found in (a).



For z = 0, is the function za , defined by (1.8.7), always multi-valued? To answer
this question, let us use the formula (1.8.5) for log z and write
za = ea log z = ea( Log z+2kπ i) = ea Log z e2kaπ i ,
where k is an integer. To determine the number of distinct values of za , we must
determine the number of distinct values taken by e2kaπ i as k varies over the integers.
We distinguish three cases.
Case (i): a is an integer. Then 2kaπ i is an integer multiple of 2π i, and hence
e2kaπ i = 1 for all integers k. The expression za has only one value. This result is
in concordance with our notion of zn , z−1 , etc., as being single-valued functions.
Case (ii): a is a (real) rational number. Write a = qp , where p and q are integers and
pk

have no common factors. The quantity e2kaπ i = e2π i q will have q distinct values,
for k = 0, 1, . . . , q − 1 (see Exercise 53). Thus, for each value of k = 0, 1, . . . , q − 1,
we obtain a distinct power function
p

p

called a branch of z . The branch for k = 0 is called the principal branch of z q .
This result is in accordance with our notion of nth roots z1/n ; there are n of them.
Note also that case (i) is just case (ii) with q = 1.
Case (iii): a is a complex number not of either of the preceding two types. This is
the case when a is an irrational real number or a complex number with a nonzero
imaginary part. Then the quantities e2kaπ i are distinct for all integers k (Exercise 54),
and za has an infinite number of values. As in case (ii), each value of k determines a
branch of za , except that here we have infinitely many distinct branches.
Note that our definition of a complex power is inconsistent with our definition of
the complex exponential ez . According to (1.8.7), we can take e and raise it to the
power a, resulting in
ea = ea log e = ea ln e ea2kπ i ,
which is, in general, multi-valued. We must distinguish this concept of “raising e to
the power a” from our previous, single-valued definition of the “exponential function.” As a convention, ez will always refer to the exponential function, unless otherwise stated.
The last example of this section deals with inverse trigonometric functions. These
may be computed using complex powers and logarithms, and so they are multivalued in general. For example, the inverse sine of z is an arbitrary complex number
w = sin−1 z with sin w = z. The solutions of the last equation form an infinite set,
and so sin−1 z is infinite-valued.
Example 1.8.8. (Computing the inverse sine function) Show that


1
sin−1 z = −i log iz + (1 − z2 ) 2 ,

(1.8.10)

where the complex logarithm is defined in (1.8.3). (For every z = 0, the square
root takes two values, and the complex logarithm is infinite-valued. As a result the
inverse sine is infinite-valued.)
Solution. We want to solve sin w = z. Recalling the definition of sin w from (1.7.4)
we have
eiw − e−iw
z=

2i
or, after multiplying both sides by eiw and simplifying,
eiw

− 2izeiw − 1 = 0.

This is a quadratic equation in eiw , which is solved solve via the quadratic formula
(1.3.25):
1
eiw = iz + (1 − z2 ) 2 ,
where the square root has two values in general. The desired identity (1.8.10) follows now upon taking logarithms.

Analytic Functions
I get up at 4 o’clock each morning and I am busy from then
on. . . Today I drew the plans for forges that I am to have built in
granite. I am also constructing two lighthouses, one on each of
the two piers that are located at the entrance of the harbor. I do
not get tired of working; on the contrary, it invigorates me and I
am in perfect health. . .
-Augustin-Louis Cauchy (1789–1857)
Complex analysis is concerned with the study of analytic functions. These are
functions that have a complex derivative in an open planar set. The notion of analyticity is fundamental in complex analysis; it lays the foundational cornerstone and
sets the stage for the development of the subject. Most of the theory of analytic functions is due to Augustin-Louis Cauchy (1789–1857) and was prepared for a course
that he taught at the Institut de France in 1814 and later at the Ecole Polytechnique.
Cauchy single-handedly defined the derivative and integral of complex functions
and developed one of the most fruitful theories of mathematics. In the process of
developing his theory, he defined for the first time the notion of limit for functions
and gave rigorous definitions of continuity and differentiability for real-valued functions, as are known nowadays in calculus. He also developed a solid groundwork for
the theory of definite integrals and series and he established the theoretical aspects
of complex analysis. In doing so, he paid great attention to rigorous mathematical
proof, a trait that characterizes pure mathematics today.
So who was Cauchy? Augustin-Louis Cauchy was born on August 21, 1789,
in Paris. He received his early education from his father, Louis-François Cauchy, a
master of classical studies. Cauchy entered the Ecole Polytechnique in Paris in 1805
and continued his education as a civil engineer at the Ecole des Ponts et Chaussées.
He began his career as a military engineer, working in Napoleon’s administration
from 1810 to 1813. His mathematical talents were soon discovered by leading mathematicians, among them was Joseph Louis Lagrange, who persuaded Cauchy to
leave his career as an engineer and devote himself to mathematics. Cauchy’s mathematical output was phenomenal. He is considered to be one of the greatest mathematicians. His contributions cover many areas of pure and applied mathematics, including the theory of heat, the theory of light, the mathematical theory of elasticity,
and fluid dynamics. Cauchy’s contributions to modern calculus are so fundamental
that he “has come to be regarded as the creator of calculus in the modern sense,”
according to The History of Mathematics, An Introduction, 3rd edition, by David
M. Burton (McGraw-Hill, 1997).

2 Analytic Functions

2.1 Regions of the Complex Plane
In the previous chapter, we defined some elementary functions of a complex variable. An important part of a function is its domain of definition. In calculus, functions are usually defined over intervals. For functions of a complex variable, intervals are replaced by subsets of the complex plane. For this reason, in order to
develop the theory of functions of a complex variable, it is necessary to understand
basic properties of subsets of the complex plane.

Open Sets
One very useful definition is that of a neighborhood of a point. It is the analog of an
open interval in one dimension.
Definition 2.1.1. (Neighborhoods) Let r > 0 be a positive real number and z0 a
point in the plane. The r-neighborhood of z0 is the set of all complex numbers z
satisfying |z − z0 | < r. We denote1 this set by Br (z0 ).

Fig. 2.1 An r-neighborhood
Br (z0 ) does not include the
points on the circle |z − z0 | = r.

Fig. 2.2 A closed disk includes its boundary, the circle
|z − z0 | = r.

Interpreting the absolute value as a distance, we visualize Br (z0 ) as the disk centered at z0 with radius r > 0. The fact that the inequality |z−z0 | < r is strict expresses
the property that the points on the circle |z − z0 | = r are not part of this disk. In Figure 2.1, the dashed circle |z − z0 | = r indicates exactly the noninclusion of the circle
|z − z0 | = r in the r-neighborhood Br (z0 ) of z0 .
A neighborhood of z0 from which we have deleted the center z0 is called a
deleted neighborhood or punctured neighborhood of z0 and is denoted by Br (z0 ).
Thus
Br (z0 ) = {z : 0 < |z − z0 | < r}.

The letter B is used for an open disk because its higher-dimensional analog is an “open ball.”

Definition 2.1.2. Let S be a subset of C. A point z0 in S is called an interior point of
S if we can find a neighborhood of z0 that is wholly contained in S. A point z in the
complex plane is called a boundary point of S if every neighborhood of z contains
at least one point in S and at least one point not in S. The set of all boundary points
of S is called the boundary of S.
Definition 2.1.2 implies that every point in S is either an interior point or a boundary point. If a point is an interior point of S, then it cannot be a boundary point of
S. Also, while an interior point of S is necessarily a point in S, a boundary point of
S need not be in S. The geometric concepts in Definition 2.1.2 are intuitively clear;
however, dealing with them often requires delicate handling of the absolute value.
Example 2.1.3. (Interior and boundary points of r-neighborhoods Br (z0 ))
(a) Show that every point z of Br (z0 ) is an interior point.
(b) Show that the boundary of Br (z0 ) is the circle |z − z0 | = r.
Solution. (a) Pick a point z in Br (z0 ). As one can see in Figure 2.3, we can find
a disk centered at z, which lies entirely in Br (z0 ). Hence z is an interior point of
Br (z0 ). To give an analytic proof of this geometric argument, let δ = |z − z0 |. By the
definition of Br (z0 ), we have 0 ≤ δ < r. Let δ  = r − δ . For w in the neighborhood
Bδ  (z), we have |w − z| < δ  and so, by the triangle inequality,
|w − z0 | ≤ |w − z| + |z − z0 | < δ  + δ = r.
Hence w belongs to Br (z0 ), and since this is true of every w in Bδ  (z), we conclude
that Bδ  (z) is contained in Br (z0 ).
(b) Pick a point z1 on the circle |z − z0 | = r.
It is clear from Figure 2.3 that every disk
centered at z1 contains (infinitely many)
points in Br (z0 ) and (infinitely many) points
not in Br (z0 ). Hence every point on the circle |z − z0 | is a boundary point of Br (z0 ).
We now show that no other points are
boundary points. Since points inside the
circle are interior points, they cannot be
boundary points. Also, points outside the
circle can be enclosed in open disks that do
not intersect Br (z0 ). Hence such points are
not boundary points either.

Fig. 2.3 The point z is an interior point of Br (z0 ), while z1 is
a boundary point.

In this example none of the boundary points of Br (z0 ) belong to Br (z0 ).



Definition 2.1.4. (Open Sets) A subset S of the complex numbers is called open if
every point in S is an interior point of S.
Thus S is open if around each point z in S you can find a neighborhood Br (z)
that is entirely contained in S. The radius of Br (z) depends on z and may be chosen

98

as small as we wish. Also, if we can find one value of r, say r0 , such that Br0 (z)
is contained in S, then we can find infinitely many values of r such that Br (z) is
contained in S: Just take 0 < r < r0 . Here are some useful examples to keep in mind.
• The empty set, denoted as usual by 0,
/ is open. Because there are no points in 0,
/
the definition of open sets is vacuously satisfied.
• The set of all complex numbers C is open.
• An r-neighborhood, Br (z0 ), is open. We just verified in Example 2.1.3(a) that
every point in Br (z0 ) is an interior point.
• The set of all z such that |z − z0 | > r is open. This set is called a neighborhood
of ∞.
An r-neighborhood, Br (z0 ), is more commonly called an open disk of radius r,
centered at z0 .
One can show that a set is open if and only if it contains none of its boundary
points (Exercise 18). Sets that contain all of their boundary points are called closed.
The complex plane C and the empty set 0/ are closed since they trivially contain
their empty sets of boundary points. The disk {z : |z − z0 | ≤ r} is closed because it
contains all its boundary points consisting of the circle |z − z0 | = r (Figure 2.2). We
refer to such a disk as the closed disk of radius r, centered at z0 . The smallest closed
set that contains a set A is called the closure of A and is denoted by A. For instance
the closure of the open disk Br (z0 ) is the closed disk Br (z0 ) = {z : |z − z0 | ≤ r}.
The punctured open disk Br (z0 ) also has the same closure. A point z0 is called an
accumulation point of a set A if Br (z) ∩ A = 0/ for every r > 0. For instance, every
boundary point of an open disk is an accumulation point of it.
Some sets are neither open nor closed.
For example, the set
S = {z : |z − z0 | ≤ r; Im z > 0}
contains the boundary points on the upper semicircle, but it does not contain its
boundary points that lie on the x-axis.
Hence, this set is neither open nor closed.
See Figure 2.4.
Fig. 2.4 S is neither open nor closed.

Next, we introduce some set notation for convenience. If a point z is in a set S,
we say that z is an element of S and write z ∈ S. If z does not belong to S, we will
write z ∈ S. Let A and B be two sets of complex numbers. The union of A and B,
denoted A ∪ B, is the set
A ∪ B = {z : z ∈ A or z ∈ B} .
The intersection of A and B, denoted A ∩ B, is the set

2.1 Regions of the Complex Plane

99

A ∩ B = {z : z ∈ A and z ∈ B} .
Two sets A and B are disjoint if A ∩ B = 0.
/ The set difference between A and B is
the set
A \ B = {z : z ∈ A and z ∈ B} .
We say that A is a subset of B or that B contains A and we write A ⊂ B or B ⊃ A if
every element of A is also an element of B: z ∈ A ⇒ z ∈ B.

Connected Sets
A basic result from calculus states that if the derivative of a differentiable function
is constant on open interval, then the function is constant on that interval. This result
is not true if the domain of definition of the function is not connected. For example,
consider the function

1 if 0 < t < 1,
h(t) =
−1 if 2 < t < 3,
whose domain of definition is (0, 1) ∪ (2, 3). We have h (t) = 0 for all t in the union
(0, 1) ∪ (2, 3), but clearly h is not constant. This example shows that the connectedness of the domain is required in order to have consistent behavior and be able
to derive important conclusions for functions. For subsets of the plane, one way to
define connectedness is as follows.
Definition 2.1.5. A polygonal line is a finite union of closed line segments L j ,
j = 1, . . . , m, such that the end of each L j coincides with the beginning of L j+1
( j = 1, . . . , m−1). A subset Ω of the complex plane is called polygonally connected
if any two points in Ω can be joined by a polygonal line entirely contained in it.
We denote by [z0 , z1 ] the line segment
{(1 − t)z0 + tz1 : t ∈ [0, 1]}
that joins two fixed points z0 , z1 ∈ C.
A polygonal line ∪mj=1 [z j−1 , z j ] can be
thought of as a map L from the interval [0, m] to the complex plane defined
as follows:
L(t) = ( j − t)z j−1 + (t − j + 1)z j
for t ∈ [ j − 1, j], j = 1, . . . , m. Then
L( j) = z j ,
i.e., L(t) passes through the point z j at
“time” t = j. See Figure 2.5.

line (m = 3).

Definition 2.1.6. A nonempty open and polygonally connected subset of the complex plane is called a region.2
Polygonally connected open sets are exactly the connected sets known from
topology. This characterization is proved now.
Proposition 2.1.7. (Characterization of Regions) A nonempty open subset Ω of
the complex plane is polygonally connected if and only if it cannot be written as
the disjoint union of two nonempty open subsets. Consequently, if Ω is a region and
Ω = A ∪ B, where A and B are open and disjoint, then either A = 0/ or B = 0.
/
Proof. It is best to prove the equivalence of the negations of the claimed assertions.
Suppose we can write Ω = A ∪ B, where A, B are disjoint nonempty open sets. If
L(t) is a polygonal line that joins a point z0 ∈ A to a point zm ∈ B, note that the set
{t ∈ [0, m] : L(t) ∈ A} is nonempty as it contains 0 and is bounded above by m. We
define
t∗ = sup{t ∈ [0, m] : L(t) ∈ A}.
Now L(t∗ ) should lie in A or B. If L(t∗ ) lies in B, then by the openness of B, A∩B = 0.
/
If L(t∗ ) lies in A, then by the openness of A, there is another point t  > t∗ with
L(t  ) ∈ A, contradicting the definition of t∗ . Hence we obtain that the polygonal line
L is not contained in Ω = A ∪ B and consequently, Ω is not polygonally connected.
Conversely, suppose that Ω is not polygonally connected. Then there exist
z0 , z1 ∈ Ω that are not connected via a polygonal line. We show that there exist
open disjoint nonempty sets A and B such that Ω = A ∪ B. We define
A ={z ∈ Ω : z is connected to z0 via a polygonal line}
B ={z ∈ Ω : z is not connected to z0 via a polygonal line}.
Since z0 ∈ A, z1 ∈ B, these sets are nonempty. Also A and B are open, since if z is (or
is not) connected to z0 via a polygonal line, then so does an arbitrary point w that

lies in an open disk contained in Ω centered at z.
In topology, connected sets in the
plane are exactly the ones that cannot
be written as a union of two disjoint
nonempty open sets. Proposition 2.1.7
indicates that open sets are connected
if and only if they are polygonally connected. This characterization provides
an intuitive way to determine which
open subsets of the complex plane are
regions.

some authors prefer the term domain for regions

Fig. 2.6 The open annulus
Ar1 ,r2 (z0 ) is a region.

2.1 Regions of the Complex Plane

101

Here are some useful examples of regions:
• An open disk Br (z0 ) is a region.
• A punctured disk centered at z0 , Br (z0 ) = {z : 0 < |z − z0 | < r} is a region.
• An open annulus centered at z0 , Ar1 ,r2 (z0 ) = {z : r1 < |z − z0 | < r2 } is a region
(Figure 2.6).
• The open upper half-plane {z : Im z > 0} is a region.
• The complex plane is a region.
Here are sets that are not regions.
• A closed disk is not a region because it is not open.
• The union of two disjoint open disks, for example, B1 (0) ∪ B 1 (2i), is not a region
2
because it is not connected.
• An interval (a, b) is not a region because it is not an open subset of the complex
plane.

Stereographic Projection
Suppose that a sphere of radius one, called a Riemann sphere, is positioned on the
complex plane with its equator coinciding with the unit circle (Figure 2.7). Let N be
the north pole of the sphere and let z be a point in the complex plane. The line from
N to z intersects the sphere at one other point z . Conversely, if z is a point of the
sphere other than the north pole, then the line from N to z will intersect the plane
at a single point z. It is not difficult to see that the mapping P that takes z to z is
one-to-one from the sphere minus the north pole onto the complex plane.
This mapping, known as the stereographic projection, was introduced by
the German mathematician Bernhard
Riemann (1826–1866). It enables us to
represent points in the complex plane
by points on the sphere, and vice versa.
This also suggests that we introduce the
point at infinity, z = ∞, as the image
of the north pole by the stereographic
projection. Thus P(N) = ∞. The complex plane together with this point at infinity is called the extended complex

For example, for R large, the open set |z| > R consisting of all complex numbers
z that are exterior to the circle |z| = R, is mapped by the stereographic projection
onto points that are near the north pole. For this reason, the set |z| > R is called a
neighborhood of ∞. See Exercise 22 for additional properties.

2.2 Limits and Continuity
Before studying differentiation it will be important to understand limits of complex
functions. Using limits we also define and study continuous functions.

Fig. 2.8 To say that f (z) → L as z → z0 is a strong assertion; it means that no
matter how z approaches z0 , the distance | f (z) − L| tends to 0.

Definition 2.2.1. (Limits of Complex-valued Functions) Let f be a complexvalued function defined on subset S of the complex plane and let z0 be an accumulation point of S. We say that a complex number L is a limit of f (z) as z approaches
z0 , if for an arbitrary ε > 0 there exists a δ > 0 such that
z∈S

and

0 < |z − z0 | < δ

=⇒

| f (z) − L| < ε .

(2.2.1)

If such a complex number L exists, then we say that limz→z0 f (z) exists and is equal
to L, and in this case we write limz→z0 f (z) = L or we say that f (z) → L as z → z0 .

104

2 Analytic Functions

Geometrically, interpreting the absolute value | f (z) − L| as the distance between
f (z) and L, we see from (2.2.1) that the function f (z) has limit L as z → z0 if and
only if the distance from f (z) to L tends to zero as z tends to z0 . See Figure 2.8.
Thus, limz→z0 f (z) = L if and only if
lim | f (z) − L| = 0.

z→z0

(2.2.2)

Note that in (2.2.1) the function f need not be defined at z0 .
Proposition 2.2.2. (Uniqueness of Limits) If f is defined on a subset S of C, z0 is
an accumulation point of S, and limz→z0 f (z) exists, then it is a unique.
Proof. Suppose that limz→z0 f (z) = L and limz→z0 f (z) = L , where L, L are different complex numbers. Then for ε = |L − L |/2 > 0 there is a δ > 0 such that
1
0 < |z − z0 | < δ =⇒ | f (z) − L| < |L − L |
2
1
0 < |z − z0 | < δ =⇒ | f (z) − L | < |L − L |.
2
Adding, we obtain that for 0 < |z − z0 | < δ we must have
1
1
|L − L | ≤ | f (z) − L| + | f (z) − L | < |L − L | + |L − L | = |L − L |,
2
2
which is a contradiction since |L − L | < |L − L | is impossible.

Example 2.2.3. Prove that:
(b)
(a) lim z = z0
z→z0



lim c = c, where c is a constant.

z→z0

Solution. (a) Given ε > 0, we want to find a δ > 0 so that
0 < |z − z0 | < δ

⇒

| f (z) − L| < ε .

Identifying f (z) = z and L = z0 , this becomes
0 < |z − z0 | < δ

⇒

|z − z0 | < ε .

Clearly, the choice δ = ε will do.
(b) The inequality | f (z) − L| = |c − c| < ε holds for any choice of δ > 0, and this

shows that limz→z0 c = c.
Definition 2.2.4. A function g is called bounded on a set S if there is a positive real
number M such that |g(z)| ≤ M for all z in S.
For example, the function 3z + 2 + i is bounded on the disk S = {z : |z| < 5} since

2.2 Limits and Continuity

105

√
√
|3z + 2 + i| ≤ 3|z| + |2 + i| ≤ (3)(5) + 5 = 15 + 5,
by the triangle inequality and the fact that |z| < 5.
Theorem 2.2.5. (Squeeze Theorem) Let f , g be defined on a subset S of C and let
z0 be an accumulation point of S.
(i) Suppose that f (z) → 0 as z → z0 and |g(z)| ≤ | f (z)| in a deleted neighborhood
of z0 . Then g(z) → 0 as z → z0 .
(ii) Suppose that f (z) → 0 as z → z0 and g(z) is bounded in a deleted neighborhood
of z0 . Then f (z)g(z) → 0 as z → z0 .
Proof. (i) Since f (z) → 0, given ε > 0, there is a δ such that | f (z)| < ε whenever
0 < |z − z0 | < δ . But since |g(z)| ≤ | f (z)|, we also have |g(z) − 0| < ε whenever
0 < |z − z0 | < δ , which implies that g(z) → 0 as z → z0 .
(ii) Since g is bounded in a deleted neighborhood of z0 , we can find M > 0 and r > 0
such that |g(z)| ≤ M for 0 < |z − z0 | < r. For 0 < |z − z0 | < r, we have
0 ≤ | f (z)g(z)| ≤ M| f (z)|.
Since M| f (z)| → 0, it follows from (i) that f (z)g(z) → 0.



Example 2.2.6. Compute lim ( Im z)ei/|z| .
z→0

Solution. For z = x + iy, x, y real, let f (z) = y and g(z) = ei/|z| . As z → 0, f (z) → 0.
Also, for z = 0, since 1/|z| is a purely real number, we have |ei/|z| | = 1, by (1.6.11).
Thus, applying Theorem 2.2.5(ii), we conclude that lim yei/|z| = 0.

z→0

Computing more complicated limits by recourse to the (ε , δ )-definition (2.2.1)
is not always easy. To simplify this task, we will use properties of limits.
Theorem 2.2.7. (Operations with Limits) Let f , g be functions defined on a subset
S of the complex plane and let z0 be an accumulation point of S. Suppose that both
lim f (z) and lim g(z) exist and that c1 , c2 are complex constants. Then

It is often advantageous to study the limit of a complex-valued function by studying properties of the limits of the real and imaginary parts of it. This is possible
because of the following simple characterization.
Theorem 2.2.9. Let u, v be real-valued functions defined on a subset S of C and let
z0 be an accumulation point of S and L = a + i b be a complex number. Then we have
that the function f = u + i v satisfies
lim f (z) = L

z→z0

⇐⇒

lim u(z) = a and

z→z0

lim v(z) = b.

z→z0

Proof. We have
lim f (z) = L ⇔ lim | f (z) − L| = 0 ⇔ lim | f (z) − L|2 = 0.

2.2 Limits and Continuity

107

We have avoided thus far dealing with limits that involve ∞. What do we mean by
statements such as limz→z0 f (z) = ∞ or limz→∞ f (z) = L or even limz→∞ f (z) = ∞?
We answer these questions by introducing the following definitions.
Definition 2.2.10. (Limits Involving Infinity)
(i) If f is defined in a deleted neighborbood of z0 we write limz→z0 f (z) = ∞ to
mean that for every M > 0 there is a δ > 0 such that 0 < |z − z0 | < δ ⇒ | f (z)| > M.
(ii) If f is defined in the complement of a ball centered at the origin we write
limz→∞ f (z) = L to mean that for every ε > 0 there is an R > 0 such that |z| > R ⇒
| f (z) − L| < ε .
(iii) If f is defined in the complement of a ball centered at the origin we write
limz→∞ f (z) = ∞ to mean that for every M > 0 there is an R > 0 such that |z| > R ⇒
| f (z)| > M.
Looking at these definitions, we see that z → ∞ means that the real quantity
|z| → ∞, and similarly f (z) → ∞ means that | f (z)| → ∞. Hence
lim f (z) = ∞

lim f (z) = L

⇔

z→∞

lim f (z) = ∞

z→∞

lim | f (z)| = ∞;

⇔

z→z0

lim | f (z) − L| = 0;

(2.2.9)

lim | f (z)| = ∞.

(2.2.10)

|z|→∞

⇔

|z|→∞

Limits at infinity can also be reduced to limits at z0 = 0 by means of the inversion
1/z. The idea is that taking the limit as z → ∞ of f (z) is the same procedure as taking
the limit as z → 0 of f 1z . It is straightforward to verify that
lim f (z) = L

While we have successfully used skills from calculus to compute complexvalued limits, real-variable intuition may not always apply. For example, the limit
limz→∞ e−z is not 0; in fact, this limit does not exist (Exercise 21).

Continuous Functions
Often, the limit of a function as the variable approaches a point equals with the value
of the function at this point. This property is called continuity.
Definition 2.2.12. Let f be defined on an a subset S of C and let z0 be a point in S.
We say that f is continuous atz0 if for every ε > 0 there is a δ > 0 such that
z ∈ S,

|z − z0 | < δ =⇒ | f (z) − f (z0 )| < ε .

(2.2.14)

The function f is called continuous on S if it is continuous at every point in S.
If z0 is not an accumulation point of S there is a δ > 0 with B (z0 , δ ) ∩ S = 0;
/ then
z ∈ S and |z − z0 | < δ =⇒ z = z0 , thus f is continuous at z0 , as (2.2.14) is satisfied
for any ε > 0. If z0 ∈ S happens to be an accumulation point of S, then (2.2.1) [with
L = f (z0 )] is equivalent to (2.2.14), since obviously (2.2.14) holds when z = z0 ; in
this case f is continuous at z0 if and only if limz→z0 f (z) = f (z0 ).
Since continuity is defined in terms of limits, many properties of limits extend to
continuous functions.
Theorem 2.2.13. Let f , g be complex-valued functions defined on a subset S of C
and let z0 be a point in S. Suppose that f , g are continuous at z0 . Let c1 , c2 be
complex constants. Then the following assertions are valid:

2.2 Limits and Continuity

109

(i) Re f and Im f are continuous at z0 .
(ii) c1 f + c2 g, f g are continuous at z0 .
(iii) f /g is continuous at z0 , provided g(z0 ) = 0.
(iv) If h is defined on a set containing f (z0 ) and is continuous at f (z0 ), then the
composition h ◦ f is continuous at z0 .
Proof. Assertion (i) is a consequence of Theorem 2.2.9. The proofs of (ii) and
(iii) are immediate consequences of Theorem 2.2.7. To prove (iv), in view of the
continuity of h at f (z0 ), given ε > 0 we find a δ > 0 such that
|w − f (z0 )| < δ

w ∈ f [S] and

=⇒

|h(w) − h( f (z0 ))| < ε .

For the positive δ we found, by the continuity of f at z0 , there is a η > 0 such that
z∈S

and

|z − z0 | < η

| f (z) − f (z0 )| < δ .

=⇒

Putting these implications together and using that z ∈ S implies f (z) ∈ f [S], we
obtain:
z∈S

and

|z − z0 | < η

=⇒

|h( f (z)) − h( f (z0 ))| < ε ,

thus proving (iv).

Example 2.2.14. (Polynomial and rational functions)
(a) Let a j ∈ C. Show that a polynomial p(z) = an zn + an−1 zn−1 + · · · + a0 is continuous at all points in the plane.
(b) A rational function is a function of the form
r(z) =

p(z)
,
q(z)

where p and q are polynomials. This is defined for all z ∈ C for which q(z) = 0.
Show that a rational function is continuous at all points where q(z) = 0.
Solution. (a) Since the function f (z) = z is continuous, we use the fact that the
product of two continuous functions is continuous to conclude that z2 , z3 , . . . , zn are
continuous. Then, by repeated applications of the fact that a linear combination of
continuous functions is continuous, we conclude that an zn + an−1 zn−1 + · · · + a0 is a
continuous function.
(b) By part (a), the polynomials p and q are continuous in the entire plane. Hence
p(z)
is continuous on C except at those points where q(z) = 0.

r(z) = q(z)

Solution. (a) Since z + 2 = 0 when z = 2i, the function in (a) is continuous at z = 2i
by Example 2.2.14(b). The limit as z → 2i is then computed by evaluation:

(b) The denominator z2 + 1 vanishes at z = i and so the rational function in (b) is not
continuous at z = i. Does the limit exist at z = i? We have
f (z) =

In Example 2.2.15(b), the limz→i f (z) exists at the point of discontinuity z = i,
and for this reason the discontinuity of f at this point can be removed by redefining
f (i) = −i/2. Such a point of discontinuity is called a removable discontinuity.
If the discontinuity at a point cannot be removed, then it is called a
nonremovable discontinuity. The
examples below concern nonremovable discontinuities. We use the
uniqueness of the limit to show that
a limit fails to exist. The method
works as follows: If one can show
that f (z) → L as z approaches z0
on curve C but f (z) → L as z approaches z0 on curve C , and L = L ,
then, by the uniqueness of limits, we
conclude that limz→z0 f (z) does not
exist. See Figure 2.9.

if L = L .

Solution. Write z = x + iy where x and y are not both equal to 0. We follow the
strategy outlined before the example and show that limz→0 f (z) does not exist by
letting z approach 0 in two different ways: Once along the x-axis (that is, y = 0 and
z = x) and once along the y-axis (that is, x = 0 and z = iy). For z = x, we have
lim

For z = iy with y real, we have Re z = 0, and so

Since we have obtained different limits as we approached 0 in different ways, we
conclude that the function Rez z has no limit as z → 0.

The next example involves a function with infinitely many nonremovable discontinuities.
Example 2.2.17. (The nonremovable discontinuities of Arg z) The principal branch
of the argument Arg z takes the value of argument z that is in the interval −π <
Arg z ≤ π . It is not defined at z = 0 and hence Arg z is not continuous at z = 0.
We show that z = 0 is not a removable discontinuity of Arg z by showing that
limz→0 Arg z does not exist.
Indeed, if z = x > 0, then Arg z = 0 and so
limz=x↓0 Arg z = 0, where the down-arrow denotes the limit from the right, also denoted as
limz=x→0+ Arg z. However, if z = x < 0, then
Arg z = π and so limz=x↑0 Arg z = π , where the
up-arrow denotes the limit from the left, also denoted as limz=x→0− Arg z. By the uniqueness of
limits, we conclude that limz→0 Arg z does not
exist. Also, for a point on the negative x-axis,
z0 = x0 < 0, we have Arg z0 = π . If z approaches
z0 from the second quadrant, say along a curve
C as in Figure 2.10, we have limz→z0 Arg z =
Fig. 2.10 Arg z has nonremovπ = Arg z0 . But if z approaches z0 from the third
able discontinuities at z = 0 and

quadrant, say along curve C as shown in Figat all negative real z.
ure 2.10, we have limz→z0 Arg z = −π .
Hence Arg z is not continuous at z0 and the discontinuity is not removable, because limz→z0 Arg z does not exist for such z0 . It is not hard to show, using geometric
considerations, that for z = 0 and z not on the negative x-axis, Arg z is continuous.
Since the set of points of continuity of Arg z is the complex plane C minus the interval (−∞, 0] on the real line, the principal branch of the argument is continuous on
C \ (∞, 0].

Many important functions of several variables are made up of products, quotients,
and linear combinations of functions of a single variable. For example, the function
u(x, y) = ex cos y is the product of two functions of a single variable each; namely,
ex and cos y. The exponential function ez = ex (cos y + i sin y) is a linear combination
of two products of functions of a single variable. In establishing the continuity of
such functions, the following simple observations are very useful.

112

2 Analytic Functions

Proposition 2.2.18. Suppose that φ (x) is a continuous function of a single variable
x defined on an interval (a, b). Then the function f (x, y) = φ (x) is continuous at
(x0 , y0 ) whenever x0 is in (a, b). Similarly, g(x, y) = φ (y) is continuous at (x0 , y0 )
whenever y0 is in (a, b).
Proof. If (x, y) → (x0 , y0 ), then x → x0 and so φ (x) → φ (x0 ) and, consequently,
f (x, y) = φ (x) → φ (x0 ) = f (x0 , y0 ). Thus f is continuous at (x0 , y0 ) as claimed.
The second part of the proposition follows similarly.

Combined with Theorem 2.2.13, Proposition 2.2.18 becomes a handy tool. Here
are some interesting applications.
Example 2.2.19. (Exponential and trigonometric functions) Show that the following are continuous functions of z.
(b) cos z
(a) ez
Solution. (a) We know from calculus that the functions ex , cos x, and sin x are continuous for all x. By Proposition 2.2.18, the functions f1 (x, y) = ex , f2 (x, y) = cos y,
and f3 (x, y) = sin y are continuous for all (x, y). Appealing to Theorem 2.2.13, we
see that ex cos y + i ex sin y = ez is continuous for all (x, y).
(b) The function eiz is continuous because it is the composition of two continuous
functions; namely, i z and ez . Similarly, e−iz is continuous, and hence the linear comiz
−iz
bination e +e
= cos z is also continuous.

by the squeeze theorem.


Continuity of the Logarithms
Understanding the behavior of the logarithm is crucial to certain applications. In
view of our knowledge of Arg z and |z|, the following result is not a surprise.
Theorem 2.2.21. (Continuity of the Logarithm) The principal branch of the logarithm
Log (z) = ln |z| + i Arg (z),

−π < Arg z ≤ π

(z = 0),

(2.2.15)

is continuous for all z in C \ (−∞, 0]. For z in (−∞, 0], the discontinuities of Log z
are not removable.

2.2 Limits and Continuity

113

Proof. We showed in Example 2.2.20 that |z| is a continuous function of z. Composing the continuous function ln x, for x > 0, with the real-valued function |z|, it
follows from Theorem 2.2.13(iv) that ln |z| is continuous for all z = 0. We showed
in Example 2.2.17 that Arg z is continuous except for nonremovable discontinuities
at z = 0 and z on the negative x-axis. Appealing to Theorem 2.2.13 parts (i) and (ii),
we see that a discontinuity at z = z0 of a function f (z) = u(z) + i v(z) is removable
if and only if z0 is a removable discontinuity of both u and v (Exercise 42). Thus, in
view of the nonremovable discontinuities of Arg z, it follows that z = y, y ≤ 0, are
also nonremovable discontinuities of Log z. Thus the set of points of continuity of
Log z is C \ (−∞, 0].


Fig. 2.11 Log z has nonremovable discontinuities at z = 0 and
at all negative real z. For all
other z, Log z is continuous.

Fig. 2.12 The branch cut of
logα z is the ray at angle α .
The branch cut is the set of
nonremovable discontinuities of
logα z.

A discussion similar to the preceding one shows that a branch of the logarithm,
logα z, is continuous at all z except for nonremovable discontinuities at z = 0 and z
on the ray at angle α . The set of nonremovable discontinuities of logα z is called a
branch cut. For example, the branch cut of Log z is (−∞, 0] (Figure 2.11), and the
branch cut of logα z is the ray at angle α (Figure 2.12).

2.3 Analytic Functions
The derivative of a real-variable function h(x) at a point x0 is defined as h (x0 ) =
0)
limx→x0 h(x)−h(x
, when the limit exists. The definition of the derivative of a comx−x0
plex function is a natural extension of the real one.
Definition 2.3.1. (Complex Derivative) Let f be defined on an open subset U of C
and let z0 ∈ U. We say that f has a complex derivative at the point z0 if the limit
lim

z→z0

f (z) − f (z0 )
z − z0

(2.3.1)

exists. If this is the case, then the number in (2.3.1) is called the complex derivative
of f at z0 and is denoted by f  (z0 ).

2.3 Analytic Functions

115

We say that f is analytic on U if it has a complex derivative at every point in
U. We also say that f is analytic at a point w in U if it is analytic on some open
neighborhood of w contained in U.
While this extension looks similar to the definition of a derivative of functions
defined on the real line, we are asking a lot more in the complex case. In the real
case, x can only approach x0 from either the right or the left. In the complex case, z
can approach z0 from any number of directions. For the derivative to exist, we are
requiring that the limit exists no matter how we approach z0 in (2.3.1).
Definition 2.3.2. An analytic function defined on the complex plane C is said to be
entire.

Example 2.3.3. Show that the functions below are entire and find their derivatives.
(a) f (z) = 2 + 4i.
(b) g(z) = (3 − i)z.
(c) h(z) = z2 .
Solution. We use the difference quotient as in (2.3.1) to calculate the derivatives.
(a) Fix z0 in the plane. Since f (z) = 2 + 4i is constant, f (z) = f (z0 ) for all z. Hence
f (z)− f (z0 )
= 0. Taking the limit as z → z0 , we get f  (z0 ) = 0. Thus f  (z) = 0 for all
z−z0
z, and hence f is analytic on C, or entire.
(b) Fix z0 in the plane. We have
g(z) − g(z0 )
(3 − i) z − (3 − i) z0
= lim
= 3 − i.
z→z0
z→z0
z − z0
z − z0

g (z0 ) = lim

Thus g (z) = 3 − i for all z, and so f is entire.
(c) Fix z0 in the plane. We have
z2 − z20
(z − z0 )(z + z0 )
= lim
= lim z + z0 = 2z0 .
z→z0 z − z0
z→z0
z→z0
z − z0

h (z0 ) = lim

Thus h (z) = 2z for all z and so h is entire.



More generally, if c is a constant, we have f (z) = c ⇒ f  (z) = 0. We also have
g(z) = c z ⇒ g (z) = c.

(2.3.2)

The well-known result from calculus that differentiable functions are continuous
has an analog in the complex case.
Theorem 2.3.4. An analytic function defined on an open subset of the complex plane
is continuous.
Proof. Let z0 be a point in an open set U and let f be an analytic function on U. We
must show that limz→z0 f (z) = f (z0 ). Using the fact that the limit of a product is the
product of the limits [Property (2.2.4)], we write

Thus f is continuous at z0 .



Theorem 2.3.4 yields that a discontinuous function at z0 does not have a complex
derivative at z0 . The converse of Theorem 2.3.4 is not true: the function z is continuous on C but does not have a complex derivative at any point (Example 2.3.9).
Since complex derivatives are modeled after real ones, it should not come as a
surprise that many of the properties of real derivatives hold for analytic functions.
Theorem 2.3.5. (Properties of Analytic Functions) Suppose that f and g are analytic functions on an open subset U of the complex plane and let c1 , c2 be complex
constants.
(i) Then c1 f + c2 g and f g are analytic on U and for all z ∈ U
(c1 f + c2 g) (z) = c1 f  (z) + c2 g (z).

for ε = |g(z0 )|/2 > 0 there is a δ > 0 such that |z − z0 | < δ we have |g(z) − g(z0 )| <
|g(z0 )|/2, which implies |g(z0 )|/2 < |g(z)|, hence g(z) = 0. Then for |z − z0 | < δ
we write

where we used the continuity of g at z0 and the fact that g(z) = 0 for |z − z0 | < δ .
To prove (2.3.5) for a general f we combine (2.3.4) and (2.3.5) for f = 1.

Example 2.3.6. Show that zn (n = 1, 2, . . .) is entire and
d n
z = nzn−1 .
dz

(2.3.6)

Solution. We give a proof by induction. The case n = 1 was already stated in (2.3.2).
Suppose as an induction hypothesis that (2.3.6) holds for n; we will prove that it
holds for n + 1. Setting h(z) = zn+1 , we write h(z) = zn z. Applying the product rule
for differentiation (2.3.4) and the induction hypothesis, we get
h (z) = (zn ) z + zn z = nzn−1 z + zn = (n + 1)zn ,
as desired. Hence zn is entire and (2.3.6) is valid.

Example 2.3.7. (Analyticity of a rational function) Find the complex derivative
of
(z + 1)(z + i)2
h(z) =
z + 1 − 3i
and determine where h is analytic.
Solution. The formal manipulations are exactly as if we were working with a real
function and treating the complex numbers as real constants. We use the quotient
and product rules for differentiation, (2.3.5) and (2.3.4), and get
h (z) =
=

((z + i)2 + (z + 1)2(z + i))(z + 1 − 3i) − (z + 1)(z + i)2
(z + 1 − 3i)2

.
(z + 1 − 3i)2

This function is analytic on C \ {−1 + 3i} since at z = −1 + 3i the denominator of
h vanishes.

2 Analytic Functions

Using linear combinations of powers of z and appealing to Example 2.3.6 and the
linearity of the derivative (2.3.3), we conclude that polynomials are entire functions.
Appealing to the quotient rule, as in Example 2.3.7, we see that a rational function
is analytic at all z where g(z) = 0. The proof of the next proposition is omitted.
Proposition 2.3.8. Let n be a nonnegative integer. A polynomial of degree n, p(z) =
an zn + an−1 zn−1 + · · · + a1 z + a0 , is entire. Its derivative is
p (z) = n an zn−1 + (n − 1) an−1 zn−2 + · · · + a1 .

(2.3.7)

A rational function f (z) = p(z)/q(z), where p(z) and q(z) are polynomials, is analytic at all points z where q(z) = 0. Its derivative is
p (z)q(z) − p(z)q (z)
.

(2.3.8)

Not every complex-valued function is analytic. For instance the functions Re z,
Im z, z, and |z| are not analytic.
Example 2.3.9. (Functions that are nowhere analytic) Show that the functions
(a) z
and
(b) Re z
do not have complex derivatives at any point in C.
Solution. We establish these claims by showing that the limit (2.3.1) does not exist
for any complex number z0 . We achieve this approaching z0 from two different
directions and showing that the limits obtained are not equal.
(a) Fix a point z0 = x0 + i y0 in the plane. Our goal is to show that the limit
lim

z→z0

z − z0
z − z0

(2.3.9)

does not exist. We will approach z0 from the two directions as indicated in Figure 2.13. For z on C, we have
z = z0 + t;

z − z0 = t;

z − z0 = z − z0 = t = t,

because t is real. Thus,
lim

z→z0

z on C

z − z0
t
= lim = 1.
z − z0 t→0 t

For z on C , we have
z = z0 + it;

z − z0 = it;

z − z0 = it = −it

since it is purely imaginary. Thus,

Since the limit along C is not equal to the limit along C , we conclude that the limit in
(2.3.9) does not exist. Hence the function z is not analytic at z0 . Since z0 is arbitrary,
it follows that z is nowhere analytic.
(b) We follow the approach in (a) and use the same directions along C and C . For z
on C, Re z − Re z0 = x0 + t − x0 = t, and, for z on C , Re z − Re z0 = x0 − x0 = 0.
Thus we write
lim

z→z0

z on C

Re z − Re z0

t→0 t
z − z0

and
lim

z→z0

z on C

Re z − Re z0

= lim = 0.
t→0 it
z − z0

So the derivative of Re z does not exist
at z0 . Since z0 is arbitrary, we conclude
that Re z is nowhere analytic.

Fig. 2.13 For z ∈ C we have z − z0 =
t while for z ∈ C , z − z0 = it.

There is also a quick proof of (b) based on the result of (a) and the identity
z = 2 Re z − z. In fact, if Re z has a derivative at z0 , then by the properties of the

derivative it would follow that z has a derivative at z0 , which contradicts (a).
Suppose that f (z) has a complex derivative at a point z0 and let

ε (z) =

f (z) − f (z0 )
− f  (z0 ).
z − z0

(2.3.10)

Then ε (z) → 0 as z → z0 , because the difference quotient in (2.3.10) tends to f  (z0 ).
Solving for f (z) in (2.3.10) we obtain
linear function of z

f (z) = f (z0 ) + f  (z0 )(z − z0 ) +ε (z)(z − z0 ).

(2.3.11)

This expression shows that, near a point where f is analytic, f (z) is approximately
a linear function. The converse is also true.
Proposition 2.3.10. Let U be an open subset of C. A function f on U has a complex
derivative at a point z0 ∈ U if and only if there is a complex number A and a function
ε (z) such that
(2.3.12)
f (z) = f (z0 ) + A(z − z0 ) + ε (z)(z − z0 ),
and ε (z) → 0 as z → z0 . If this is the case, then A = f  (z0 ).
Proof. We have already one direction. For the other direction, suppose that f (z) can
be written as in (2.3.12). Then, for z = z0 ,

120

2 Analytic Functions

f (z) − f (z0 )
= A + ε (z).
z − z0

(2.3.13)

Taking the limit as z → z0 and using the fact that ε (z) → 0, we conclude that f  (z0 )
exists and equals A.

So far we have been successful in differentiating polynomials and rational functions. To go beyond these examples we need more tools, such as composition of
functions. The formalism of Proposition 2.3.10 greatly simplifies the proofs related
to compositions of analytic functions.
Theorem 2.3.11. (Chain Rule) Suppose that g is analytic on an open set U and
that f is analytic and an open set containing g[U]. Then f ◦ g is an analytic function
on U. Moreover, for z0 in U the chain rule identity holds
( f ◦ g) (z0 ) = f  (g(z0 ))g (z0 ).

(2.3.14)

Proof. Suppose g is analytic at z0 and f is analytic at g(z0 ). We want to show that
( f ◦ g) (z0 ) = f  (g(z0 ))g (z0 ).

(2.3.15)

Since g is analytic at z0 , appealing to Proposition 2.3.10, we write
g(z) − g(z0 )
= g (z0 ) + ε (z),
z − z0

ε (z) → 0 as z → z0 .

(2.3.16)

Also, f is analytic at g(z0 ), by Proposition 2.3.10 again we write
f (w) − f (g(z0 )) = f  (g(z0 ))(w − g(z0 )) + η (w)(w − g(z0 )),
where η (w) → 0 as w → g(z0 ).
Replacing w by g(z), dividing by z − z0 , and using (2.3.16), we obtain


f (g(z)) − f (g(z0 ))
= f  (g(z0 )) g (z0 ) + ε (z) + η (g(z)) g (z0 ) + ε (z) . (2.3.17)
z − z0
As z → z0 , ε (z) → 0, g(z) → g(z0 ) by continuity, and so η (g(z)) → 0. Using this in
(2.3.17), we conclude that
lim

z→z0

f (g(z)) − f (g(z0 ))
= f  (g(z0 ))g (z0 ),
z − z0

as asserted by the chain rule.



The following inside-out chain rule (illustrated in Figure 2.14) is useful when
dealing with inverse functions such as logarithms and powers.

2.3 Analytic Functions

121

Fig. 2.14 In the reverse chain rule we suppose that g is continuous and that h =
f ◦ g is analytic and we conclude that g is analytic.

Theorem 2.3.12. (Reverse Chain Rule) Suppose that g is a continuous function on
a region Ω and f is an analytic function on a region U that contains g[Ω ]. Suppose
that h = f ◦ g is analytic on Ω and that f  (g(z)) = 0 for all z in Ω . Then g is analytic
on Ω and
h (z)
,
z ∈ Ω.
(2.3.18)
g (z) = 
f (g(z))
Proof. Let z0 be in Ω . We know that h(z) = f (g(z)) analytic at z = z0 , f is analytic
at g(z0 ) with f  (g(z0 )) = 0, and g is continuous at z0 . We want to show that
g (z0 ) =

h (z0 )
.
f  (g(z0 ))

(2.3.19)

Applying Proposition 2.3.10 to h(z) = f (g(z)), we write
f (g(z)) = f (g(z0 )) + h (z0 )(z − z0 ) + ε (z)(z − z0 ),

ε (z) → 0 as z → z0 . (2.3.20)

Applying Proposition 2.3.10 to f at g(z0 ), we have
f (g(z)) = f (g(z0 )) + f  (g(z0 ))(g(z) − g(z0 )) + η (g(z))(g(z) − g(z0 )),

(2.3.21)

where η (g(z)) → 0 as g(z) → g(z0 ) or, equivalently, as z → z0 by continuity of g at
z0 . Subtract (2.3.21) from (2.3.20) and rearrange the terms to get
g(z) − g(z0 )
h (z0 ) + ε (z)
.
= 
z − z0
f (g(z0 )) + η (g(z))

(2.3.22)

As z → z0 , ε (z) → 0 and η (g(z)) → 0, implying (2.3.19). Notice that the denomina
tor in (2.3.22) does not vanish for z sufficiently close to z0 .

Example 2.3.13. (Analyticity of nth roots) Show that the principal branch of the
nth root, g(z) = z1/n (n = 0, 1, 2, . . .), is analytic in the region Ω (Figure 2.15)
described by C \ {z ∈ C : Re z ≤ 0, Im z = 0}. Also show that for z in Ω , we have

Solution. From (1.8.9), we have

g(z) = e n Log z ,
where Log z is the principal branch of
the logarithm. We showed in the previous section that ez is continuous for all
z, and since Log z is continuous in Ω ,
it follows that g(z) is continuous in Ω ,
being the composition of two continuous functions. Taking f (z) = zn , h(z) =
f (g(z)) = (z1/n )n = z, we see clearly
that f and h are analytic, and thus the
hypotheses of Theorem 2.3.12 are satisfied. Consequently, g(z) is analytic on

2.4 Differentiation of Functions of Two Real Variables
We begin by reviewing a geometric interpretation of the derivative of a real-valued
function of one variable, φ (x).

124

2 Analytic Functions

When we say that φ  (x0 ) exists, we mean
φ (x0 )
that the limit limx→x0 φ (x)−
exists and
x−x0
equals a finite number φ  (x0 ). If we set
r(x) = φ  (x0 ) −

φ (x) − φ (x0 )
,
x − x0

then limx→x0 r(x) = 0. Solving for φ (x), we obtain

φ (x) = φ (x0 ) + φ  (x0 )(x − x0 ) + r(x)(x − x0 ).
Let

ε (x) = r(x)

x − x0
,
|x − x0 |

x−x0
|x−x0 |

then, since
= ±1 and r(x) → 0 as x → x0 ,
it follows that ε (x) → 0 as x → x0 , and we have
tangent line at

Fig. 2.16 Approximating a differentiable function by its tangent line.

x0



φ (x) = φ (x0 ) + φ (x0 )(x − x0 ) +ε (x)|x − x0 |.

(2.4.1)

This expresses the well-known geometric fact that, near a point x = x0 where
the function φ (x) is differentiable with derivative φ  (x0 ), the tangent line approximates the graph of the function with an error that tends to 0 faster than |x − x0 |
(Figure 2.16).
With (2.4.1) in mind, we introduce the notion of differentiability for real-valued
functions of two real variables.
Definition 2.4.1. (Differentiability of Functions of two Real Variables) A realvalued function u(x, y) defined on an open subset U of R2 is called differentiable
at (x0 , y0 ) ∈ U if it can be written in the form
u(x, y) = u(x0 , y0 ) + A(x − x0 ) + B(y − y0 ) + ε (x, y)|(x − x0 , y − y0 )|,

(2.4.2)

where A and B are (real) constants and ε (x, y) is a function with the property
ε (x, y) → 0 as (x, y) → (x0 , y0 ).
Definition 2.4.2. Suppose that u(x, y) is a real-valued function of (x, y) defined on
a nonempty open set Ω . If we fix y, we can think of u as a function of x alone
and differentiate it with respect to x. This is called the partial derivative of u with
respect to x and is denoted by ∂∂ ux or by ux . Thus

∂u
u(x + h, y) − u(x, y)
= lim
.
∂ x h→0
h

(2.4.3)

Similarly, fixing x and thinking of u(x, y) as a function of y, differentiation with
respect to y yields
∂u
u(x, y + h) − u(x, y)
= lim
.
(2.4.4)
∂ y h→0
h

2.4 Differentiation of Functions of Two Real Variables

125

The limit in (2.4.3) involves the values of u at the point (x + h, y). This point
belongs to Ω if h is sufficiently small, because Ω is open. It is in this sense that we
interpret expressions involving limits.
Theorem 2.4.3. Suppose u is differentiable at (x0 , y0 ), so that (2.4.2) holds. Then
(i) u is continuous at (x0 , y0 ); and
(ii) ux , uy exist at (x0 , y0 ) and ux (x0 , y0 ) = A, uy (x0 , y0 ) = B.
Proof. Taking limits on both sides of (2.4.2) as (x, y) → (x0 , y0 ), we obtain
→0

→0

→0

u(x, y) = u(x0 , y0 ) + A(x − x0 ) + B(y − y0 ) + ε (x, y)|(x − x0 , y − y0 )|
and it follows that u(x, y) → u(x0 , y0 ). Hence, u is continuous at (x0 , y0 ), and (i) is
proved. For (ii), we only prove that ux (x0 , y0 ) = A, the second part being similar. To
compute ux (x0 , y0 ), we fix y = y0 and take the derivative of u(x, y0 ) with respect to
x. From (2.4.2) we have
u(x, y0 ) − u(x0 , y0 )
|x − x0 |
= A + lim ε (x, y0 )

ux (x0 , y0 ) = lim

x→x0

The converse of part (ii) of Theorem 2.4.3 is not true. A function of two variables
may have partial derivatives and yet fail to be differentiable at a point. In fact, the
function may not even be continuous at that point. As an illustration, consider the
function of two variables

when (x, y) = (0, 0).
In Exercise 1, you are asked to verify that
ux (0, 0) = uy (0, 0) = 0,
and that u is not continuous at
(0, 0). Hence by Theorem 2.4.3(i),
the function u is not differentiable
at the point (0, 0). The graph of
the function u is shown in the Figure 2.17.

Fig. 2.17 The function u(x, y)
in (2.4.5).

To obtain differentiability at a point, more than the existence of the partial derivatives is needed. We have the following interesting result.

126

2 Analytic Functions

Theorem 2.4.4. (Sufficient Conditions for Differentiability) Let u be a realvalued function defined on a neighborhood of a point (x0 , y0 ) in R2 . If
(i) ux (x0 , y0 ) and uy (x0 , y0 ) exist; and
(ii) either ux (x, y) or uy (x, y) is continuous at (x0 , y0 ),
then u is differentiable at (x0 , y0 ), and (2.4.2) holds with
A = ux (x0 , y0 )

B = uy (x0 , y0 ).

and

Proof. By reversing the roles of x and y, it is enough to prove either one of the cases
in (ii). Let us take the case where uy (x, y) is continuous at (x0 , y0 ). We have
u(x, y) − u(x0 , y0 ) = [u(x, y0 ) − u(x0 , y0 )] + [u(x, y) − u(x, y0 )] .

(2.4.6)

For fixed y0 , we think of u(x, y0 ) as a function of x alone. Since this function (of one
variable) has a derivative ux (x, y0 ), it is differentiable and we can write
u(x, y0 ) − u(x0 , y0 ) = ux (x0 , y0 )(x − x0 ) + ε1 (x)(x − x0 ),

(2.4.7)

where ε1 (x) → 0 as x → x0 .
Now for fixed x, we think of u(x, y) as a function of y alone, whose derivative is uy (x, y).
Applying the mean value theorem from singlevariable calculus, we obtain that for some number y1 strictly between y0 and y (as shown in
Figure 2.18) we have
u(x, y) − u(x, y0 ) = uy (x, y1 )(y − y0 ). (2.4.8)
Substituting (2.4.7) and (2.4.8) into (2.4.6), we
get

Fig. 2.18 Applying the mean
value theorem.

u(x, y) − u(x0 , y0 ) = [ux (x0 , y0 ) + ε1 (x)] (x − x0 ) + uy (x, y1 )(y − y0 ),

(2.4.9)

where y1 lies between y and y0 . As (x, y) → (x0 , y0 ), y tends to y0 and hence
y1 → y0 , and so uy (x, y1 ) → uy (x0 , y0 ), by the continuity of uy at (x0 , y0 ). That is,
lim(x,y)→(x0 ,y0 ) uy (x, y1 ) = uy (x0 , y0 ); equivalently,
uy (x, y1 ) = uy (x0 , y0 ) + ε2 (x, y),

ε2 (x, y) → 0 as (x, y) → (x0 , y0 ).

Inserting this in (2.4.9) and rearranging, we obtain
u(x, y) − u(x0 , y0 ) = [ux (x0 , y0 ) + ε1 (x)] (x − x0 ) + [uy (x0 , y0 ) + ε2 (x, y)] (y − y0 )
= ux (x0 , y0 )(x − x0 ) + uy (x0 , y0 )(y − y0 ) + ε (x, y)|(x − x0 , y − y0 )|,

|(x − x0 , y − y0 )|

(2.4.10)

So the required conclusion follows with A = ux (x0 , y0 ) and B = uy (x0 , y0 ) as long
as we have that ε (x, y) → 0 as (x, y) → (x0 , y0 ). But this is certainly the case as the
fractions in (2.4.10) are bounded by 1 and both ε1 (x) and ε2 (x, y) tend to zero as
(x, y) → (x0 , y0 ).

Chain Rule and Mean Value Theorems
We give simple proofs of the chain rule and the mean value theorem in two dimensions.
Theorem 2.4.5. (Chain Rule) Let u be a differentiable function on an open subset
W of R2 and let x, y be differentiable functions of t defined on an open interval I on
the real line such that (x(t), y(t)) lies in W for all t ∈ I. Then U(t) = u(x(t), y(t)) is
differentiable for all t ∈ I and we have

∂ u dx ∂ u dy
dU
=
+
.
dt
∂ x dt ∂ y dt

(2.4.11)

Proof. Fix t0 in the interval I. For the point (x(t0 ), y(t0 )) = (x0 , y0 ) in W , by Definition 2.4.1 and Theorem 2.4.4(ii), we have
u(x, y) − u(x0 , y0 ) = ux (x0 , y0 )(x − x0 ) + uy (x0 , y0 )(y − y0 ) + ε (x, y)|(x − x0 , y − y0 )|,
and by taking x = x(t) and y = y(t) for t near t0 we write
U(t) −U(t0 )
x(t) − x(t0 )
y(t) − y(t0 )
= ux (x0 , y0 )
+ uy (x0 , y0 )
t − t0
t − t0
t − t0
 |(x(t) − x0 , y(t) − y0 )|
+ ε x(t), y(t)
.
(2.4.12)
t − t0
As t → t0 we have
x(t) − x(t0 )
dx
→ (t0 )
t − t0
dt

and

y(t) − y(t0 )
dy
→ (t0 );
t − t0
dt

hence (2.4.11) will be a consequence of the preceding identity once we prove that
the term in (2.4.12) tends to zero as t → t0 . But as t → t0 , (x(t), y(t)) → (x0 , y0 ) and
0 ,y(t)−y0 )|
hence ε (x(t), y(t)) → 0. So it suffices to show that |(x(t)−xt−t
is bounded in a
0
neighborhood of t0 . We have

and since this function has a limit, it is bounded in a neighborhood of t0 .

There is also a version of the chain rule in the situation where x and y are
differentiable functions of two variables, s and t. In that case, we set U(s, t) =
u(x(s,t), y(s,t)), and then

The first formula follows by applying (2.4.11) to U(s, t) while keeping t fixed, and
the second follows by applying (2.4.11) while keeping s fixed.
Next, we discuss the mean value theorem in two dimensions.
Theorem 2.4.6. (Mean Value Theorem in Two Dimensions) Let u be a differentiable function on an open subset W of R2 . Suppose that the line segment [z1 , z2 ]
joining z1 = (x1 , y1 ) to z2 = (x2 , y2 ) lies entirely in W . Then there exists a point
z = (x0 , y0 ) on [z1 , z2 ] such that
u(x2 , y2 ) − u(x1 , y1 ) = ux (z)(x2 − x1 ) + uy (z)(y2 − y1 ).

(2.4.15)

Proof. Parametrize the line segment [z1 , z2 ] by
x(t) = x1 + t(x2 − x1 ),

y(t) = y1 + t(y2 − y1 ),

0 ≤ t ≤ 1.

dy
We have dx
dt = x2 − x1 and dt = y2 − y1 .
Form the function U(t) = u(x(t), y(t)) for 0 ≤
t ≤ 1. We have U(0) = u(x1 , y1 ), U(1) =
u(x2 , y2 ), and, by Theorem 2.4.5,

By the mean value theorem in one variable applied to U(t), there is a t0 in (0, 1) such that

(t0 )(1 − 0).

Hence

and so (2.4.15) follows with z = (x(t0 ), y(t0 )).



To motivate the next result, let us first recall the following one-dimensional result:
If f  (x) = 0 for all x in (a, b), then f (x) is a constant for all x in (a, b). To prove
this, we fix a point x0 in (a, b). Let x be in (a, b), and say a < x < x0 < b. The mean
value theorem asserts that there is a point x1 in (x, x0 ) such that
f (x0 ) − f (x) = f  (x1 )(x0 − x).
Since f  is identically zero in (x, x0 ), we conclude that f (x0 ) − f (x) = 0 or f (x) =
f (x0 ). The case x < x0 < b is treated similarly, and we obtain that f (x) = f (x0 ) for
all x in (a, b). In other words, f is constant in (a, b).
Theorem 2.4.7. Suppose that u is a real-valued function defined over a region Ω
such that ux (x, y) = 0 and uy (x, y) = 0 for all (x, y) in Ω . Then u is constant on Ω .
Proof. According to the two-dimensional mean value result (Theorem 2.4.6), for
any two points A = (x1 , y1 ) and B = (x2 , y2 ) in Ω such that the line segment AB is
also in Ω , there exists a point C = (x3 , y3 ) on the line segment AB such that
u(x2 , y2 ) − u(x1 , y1 ) = ux (x3 , y3 )(x2 − x1 ) + uy (x3 , y3 )(y2 − y1 ).
Fix a point (x0 , y0 ) in Ω . Given a point
(x, y) in Ω , connect (x0 , y0 ) to (x, y) by
a finite number of line segments joined
end to end and wholly contained in Ω .
(Here we have used the fact that Ω is
a region.) Let (x j , y j ), j = 0, 1, . . . , n
denote the endpoints of the consecutive
line segments, starting with (x0 , y0 ) and
ending with (xn , yn ) = (x, y) (see Figure 2.20). Applying (2.4.16) to each line
segment and using the fact that the partial derivatives are zero, we conclude that
u(x j−1 , y j−1 ) = u(x j , y j ), and hence that

u(x0 , y0 ) = u(x, y).

9. Project Problem: Is it true that if uy (x, y) = 0 for all (x, y) in a region Ω , then u(x, y) = φ (x);
that is, u depends only on x? The answer is no in general, as the following counterexample shows.
(a) For (x, y) in the region Ω shown in the adjacent
figure, consider the function


if x > 0,
u(x, y) =

where the signum function is defined by sgn y =
−1, 0, 1, according as y < 0, y = 0, or y > 0, respectively. Show that uy (x, y) = 0 for all (x, y) in Ω but that
u is not a function of x alone.

(b) Note that in the previous example ux does not exist for x = 0. We now construct a function over

these properties hold for

(c) Come up with a general condition on Ω that guarantees that whenever uy = 0 on Ω then
 u
depends only on x. Hint: Use the mean value theorem applied to vertical line segments in Ω .

2.5 The Cauchy-Riemann Equations
An analytic function f , defined on an open subset U of R2 , can be written as u + iv,
where u, v are real-valued functions. One may wonder if the property of f being
analytic is related to the property of u, v being differentiable in the sense of Definition 2.4.1. It turns out that there is such a strong relationship and, additionally, there
is a special relationship between the partial derivatives of u and v.
Before we explore this relationship, we discuss consequences of analyticity. Suppose that f (z) = f (x + i y) = u(x, y) + i v(x, y) is analytic in an open set U and let

Suppose that z approaches z0 along the direction of the x-axis, as in Figure 2.21.
Then z = z0 + Δ x = (x0 + Δ x, y0 ), Δ z = z − z0 = Δ x, and (2.5.1) becomes

where the last step is justified by Theorem 2.2.9 which asserts that the limit of a
complex-valued function exists if and only if the limits of its real and imaginary

x of u and v [see (2.4.3) and (2.4.4)], we obtain

Then z = z0 + i Δ y = (x0 , y0 + Δ y), Δ z = z − z0 = i Δ y. Proceeding as in (2.5.2) and

(2.5.6)

These are called the Cauchy-Riemann equations. They first appeared in 1821
in the early work of Cauchy on integrals of complex-valued functions. Their connection to the existence of the complex derivative appeared in 1851 in the doctoral
dissertation of the German mathematician Bernhard Riemann (1826–1866).
Theorem 2.5.1. (Cauchy-Riemann Equations) Let U be an open subset of R2 and
let u, v be real-valued functions defined on U. Then the complex-valued function
f (x + iy) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y) is analytic on U if and only if u, v are differentiable
functions on U and satisfy
ux = vy

and

uy = −vx

(2.5.7)

for all points in U. If this is the case, then for all (x, y) ∈ U we have
f  (x + iy) = ux (x, y) + i vx (x, y) or

f  (x + iy) = vy (x, y) − i uy (x, y).

(2.5.8)

Proof. Let us use the notation z = x +iy for a general point in U and z0 = x0 +iy0 for
a fixed point in U, where x, y, x0 , y0 are real numbers. In view of Proposition 2.3.10,
if the function f is analytic, we have
f (z) − f (z0 ) = f  (z0 )(z − z0 ) + ε (z)(z − z0 )

(2.5.9)

where ε (z) ends to zero as z → z0 . Setting f  (z0 ) = A + iB, where A, B are real, and
splitting up real and imaginary parts in (2.5.9) we obtain
u(x, y) − u(x0 , y0 ) = A(x − x0 ) − B(y − y0 ) + ε1 (x, y)|(x − x0 , y − y0 )|
v(x, y) − v(x0 , y0 ) = B(x − x0 ) + A(y − y0 ) + ε2 (x, y)|(x − x0 , y − y0 )|,
where

ε2 (x, y) = Im ε (x + iy)

|(x − x0 , y − y0 )|

2.5 The Cauchy-Riemann Equations

Note that

|ε1 (x, y)| ≤ |ε (x, y)|,

133

|ε2 (x, y)| ≤ |ε (x, y)|

and since ε (x, y) tends to zero as (x, y) → (x0 , y0 ), both ε1 (x, y) and ε2 (x, y) tend to
zero as (x, y) → (x0 , y0 ). Hence both u and v are differentiable at (x0 , y0 ). Consequently, the partial derivatives of u, v exist (Theorem 2.4.3) and we have
ux (x0 , y0 ) = A
vx (x0 , y0 ) = B

uy (x0 , y0 ) = −B
vy (x0 , y0 ) = A.

The Cauchy-Riemann equations (2.5.7) follow from this.
To prove the converse direction we assume that u and v are differentiable on U
and satisfy (2.5.7). By the definition of differentiability (Definition 2.4.1) we write
u(x, y) − u(x0 , y0 ) = ux (x0 , y0 )(x − x0 ) + uy (x0 , y0 )(y − y0 ) + ε1 (x, y)|(x − x0 , y − y0 )|
v(x, y) − v(x0 , y0 ) = vx (x0 , y0 )(x − x0 ) + vy (x0 , y0 )(y − y0 ) + ε2 (x, y)|(x − x0 , y − y0 )|
where the ε1 (x, y), ε2 (x, y) are functions that tend to zero as (x, y) → (x0 , y0 ). Adding
the displayed expressions (after multiplying the second one by i), we obtain
f (x + iy) − f (x0 + iy0 )
= (ux (x0 , y0 ) + ivx (x0 , y0 ))(x − x0 ) + (uy (x0 , y0 ) + i vy (x0 , y0 ))(y − y0 )
+ ε1 (x, y)|(x − x0 , y − y0 )| + i ε2 (x, y)|(x − x0 , y − y0 )|
= (ux (x0 , y0 ) + ivx (x0 , y0 ))(x − x0 ) + (−vx (x0 , y0 ) + i ux (x0 , y0 ))(y − y0 )
+ ε1 (x, y)|(x − x0 , y − y0 )| + i ε2 (x, y)|(x − x0 , y − y0 )|


= (ux (x0 , y0 ) + ivx (x0 , y0 ))(x − x0 + i(y − y0 )) + E(x + iy) x − x0 + i(y − y0 )
where in the second equality we used assumption (2.5.7) and we set
E(x + iy) = ε1 (x, y)
Notice that

|(x − x0 , y − y0 )|
|(x − x0 , y − y0 )|
+ i ε2 (x, y)
.
x − x0 + i(y − y0 )
x − x0 + i(y − y0 )

|E(x + iy)| ≤ |ε1 (x, y)| + |ε2 (x, y)| ,

which tends to 0 as (x, y) → (x0 , y0 ). We have now shown that
f (z) − f (z0 ) = (ux (z0 ) + ivx (z0 ))(z − z0 ) + E(z)(z − z0 )
which implies that f is analytic and that f  (z0 ) = ux (z0 ) + ivx (z0 ). This proves one
identity in (2.5.8), while the other one is a consequence of this one and (2.5.7). 
Corollary 2.5.2. If u, v are real-valued functions defined on an open subset U of R2
which have continuous partial derivatives that satisfy ux = vy , uy = −vx , then the
complex-valued function f (x + iy) = u(x, y) + iv(x, y) is analytic on U.
Proof. Apply Theorem 2.4.4.

Solution. We use Theorem 2.5.1. From (1.6.9) we have ez = ex cos y + i ex sin y if
z = x+i y, with x, y real. Thus, u(x, y) = ex cos y and v(x, y) = ex sin y. Differentiating
u with respect to x and y, we find

are continuous. By Corollary 2.5.2, ez is analytic at all points, or entire. To compute the derivative, we apply either formula from (2.5.8), say the first, and use the

by (1.7.3). The second method is a bit longer and makes use of the Cauchy-Riemann
equations. From (1.7.17) with z = x + iy, x, y real, we have
sin z = sin x cosh y + i cos x sinh y.
Hence
u(x, y) = sin x cosh y ⇒ ux (x, y) = cos x cosh y, uy (x, y) = sin x sinh y;
v(x, y) = cos x sinh y ⇒ vx (x, y) = − sin x sinh y, vy (x, y) = cos x cosh y.
Comparing partial derivatives, we see that the Cauchy-Riemann equations are satisfied at all points. Moreover, the partial derivatives are continuous. Using Theorem 2.5.1 we obtain that sin z is entire and

sin z = ux (x, y) + i vx (x, y) = cos x cosh y − i sin x sinh y = cos z,



in view of (1.7.16).

As we did in Example 2.5.4, we can verify the analyticity and compute the derivatives of cos z, tan z, and all other trigonometric and hyperbolic functions. Among the
elementary functions, it remains to consider the logarithm and complex powers.

Thus the familiar formula from calculus still holds.
Solution. In the notation of Theorem 2.3.12, set f (z) = ez , g(z) = Log z, and
h(z) = z. Since h is analytic, f is analytic with f  (z) = ez = 0, and g is continuous everywhere except on the branch cut, we conclude that g is analytic there with

(where a = 0 is a complex number).

Since Log z is analytic except at its branch cut, and ez is entire, it follows that za

chain rule and the derivatives of ez and Log z and deduce
d a
z = a za−1 ,
dz

(2.5.13)

with principal branches of the power on both sides.
We saw in Example 2.3.9 that z fails to be analytic. This fact should now be
obvious from the Cauchy-Riemann equations. If we write z = x − i y, then u(x, y) =
x, v(x, y) = −y and thus ux = 1, vy = −1; this shows that the Cauchy-Riemann
equations do not hold at any point. We now use the Cauchy-Riemann equations to
show the failure of analyticity in less obvious situations.
Example 2.5.6. (Failure of analyticity) Show that the function of two real variables
f (x + iy) = x2 + i (2y + x) is nowhere analytic.
Solution. We have u(x, y) = x2 and v(x, y) = 2y + x. Since uy = 0 and vx = 1, the
Cauchy-Riemann equations are not satisfied at any point and hence the function
cannot have a complex derivative at any point.

Theorem 2.5.7. Suppose that f = u + i v is analytic on a region Ω and satisfies
f  (z) = 0 for all z in Ω . Then f is constant in Ω .
Proof. By Theorem 2.5.1, we have
f  (z) = ux (x, y) + i vx (x, y) and f  (z) = vy (x, y) − i uy (x, y),

z in Ω .

Since f  (z) = 0 it follows that ux = uy = 0 and vx = vy = 0 in Ω . Appealing to
Theorem 2.4.7, we conclude that u is constant and v is constant, and hence f = u+i v
is constant.

We note that the connectedness
of Ω in the preceding theorem is
essential. For example, the function f defined on the shaded set S
in Figure 2.23 via

1 if |z| < 2,
f (z) =
0 if |z| > 3
has zero derivative but is not constant.

Corollary 2.5.8. Suppose that f and g are analytic in a region Ω . If either Re f =
Re g on Ω or Im f = Im g on Ω , then f = g + c on Ω , where c is a constant.

2.5 The Cauchy-Riemann Equations

137

Proof. We only consider the case Re f = Re g on Ω since the case Im f = Im g is
almost identical and is left to Exercise 32. Let h = f − g = u + iv, with u, v realvalued. We want to show that h = c on Ω . Since h is analytic, it is enough by
Theorem 2.4.7 to show that h = 0 on Ω . We have u = Re h = Re f − Re g = 0 on
Ω , and so ux = uy = 0 on Ω . By the Cauchy-Riemann equations, vx = −uy = 0.
Consequently, by (2.5.8), h = ux + ivx = 0 on Ω .

Complex Integration
Nature laughs at the difficulties of integration.
-Pierre-Simon de Laplace (1749–1827)

In this chapter we study integrals of complex-variable functions over paths. Paths
are piecewise continuously differentiable maps from closed intervals to the complex
plane. An important result proved in this chapter is an analog of the fundamental theorem of calculus for continuous functions with complex antiderivatives. This analog
says that the integral of the derivative of an analytic function is equal to the difference of the values of the function at the endpoints. We also investigate an important
question concerning the dependence of an integral on the path of integration.
Cauchy’s theorem states that the integral over a simple closed path of an analytic function defined on an open set that contains the path and its interior must be
zero. The first version (Section 3.4) is sufficient for the development of the course;
this is based on Green’s theorem from advanced calculus and makes the assumption
that derivatives of analytic functions are continuous. In the following three sections, we prove versions of Cauchy’s theorem without the continuity assumption on
the derivatives. These versions involve theoretical notions, such as deformation of
paths and simple connectedness, and offer geometric intuition and many applications. These sections may be omitted without interrupting the flow of the course.
In Section 3.8 we derive Cauchy’s generalized integral formula, which facilitates
the computation of several integrals and provides the basis for many applications.
We illustrate the power of this formula by providing a simple proof of the fundamental theorem of algebra and by deriving various striking properties of analytic
functions, including the mean value property and the maximum modulus principle.

3.1 Paths (Contours) in the Complex Plane
In this text a curve is defined as the graph of a continuous function y = f (x). This
curve could be written in parametric form by expressing
x and y as functions of a
√
third variable t. For example, the semicircle y = 1 − x2 , −1 ≤ x ≤ 1, in Figure 3.1
could be parametrized by the equations
x = x(t) = cost,

y = y(t) = sint,

0 ≤ t ≤ π.

3 Complex Integration

Fig. 3.1 Semicircle.

Fig. 3.2 A parametric interval mapping to the semicircle.

Under this parametrization, the semicircle in Figure 3.1 can be thought of as a
map from [0, π ] to the complex plane, as in Figure 3.2.
Definition 3.1.1. A parametric form of a curve is a representation of the curve by
a pair of equations x = x(t) and y = y(t), where t ranges over a set of real numbers,
usually a closed interval [a, b]. Each value of t determines a point γ (t) = (x(t), y(t)),
which traces the curve as t moves from a to b; see Figure 3.3.

Fig. 3.3 γ (t) traces the curve as t moves from t0 to t5 .

Let γ (t), a ≤ t ≤ b, be a parametrization of a curve. As t varies from a to b the
point γ (t) traces the curve in a specific direction, starting with γ (a), the initial point
of γ , and ending at γ (b), the terminal point of γ . This direction is usually denoted
by an arrow on the curve. A curve is closed if γ (a) = γ (b). For circles and circular
arcs, if the arrow points in the counterclockwise direction, we say that the curve
has positive orientation. Curves traversed in the clockwise direction have negative
orientation (see Figure 3.4).
It is a bit of a challenge to provide an exact definition of the notion of orientation
for general closed curves and we omit this, relying on the intuition provided by our
understanding of the movement of the hands of a clock in concrete examples.
A curve may have more than one parametrization. For example, the interval [0, 1]
can be parametrized as γ1 (t) = t, 0 ≤ t ≤ 1 or γ2 (t) = t 2 , 0 ≤ t ≤ 1. Both γ1 and
γ2 represent the same curve. In our analysis, we always choose and work with a
specific parametrization of the curve. For that reason, it will be convenient to refer
to a curve by its parametrization γ (t) or simply γ , even though it may have more
than one parametrization.

orientation.

Fig. 3.5 A positively oriented
arc with initial point eiα and terminal point eiβ .

Since z = x + i y, it makes sense to adopt the notation z(t) = x(t) + i y(t). In particular, we can write the parametric form of a curve γ using complex notation as

γ (t) = x(t) + i y(t),

a ≤ t ≤ b,

(3.1.1)

and think of the curve as the graph of a complex-valued function of a real variable
t. The following examples illustrate the use of the complex notation.
Example 3.1.2. (Parametric forms of arcs, circles, and line segments)
(a) The arc in Figure 3.5 is conveniently parametrized by γ (t) = eit = cost + i sint,
α ≤ t ≤ β . Its initial point is eiα , and its terminal point is eiβ .
(b) The positively oriented circle in Figure 3.6 is parametrized by

γ (t) = eit = cost + i sint,

0 ≤ t ≤ 2π .

The circle is a closed curve with initial point γ (0) = 1 and terminal point γ (2π ) = 1.

Fig. 3.6 A positively oriented
circle.

Fig. 3.7 Dilating and then translating a circle.

(c) The circle in Figure 3.7 is centered at z0 with radius R > 0. We obtain its
parametrization by dilating and then translating the equation in (b). This gives

γ (t) = z0 + Reit = z0 + R(cost + i sint),

0 ≤ t ≤ 2π .

142

3 Complex Integration

For example, the equation

γ (t) = 1 + i + 2eit ,

0 ≤ t ≤ 2π ,

represents a circle centered at the point (1, 1), with radius 2.
(d) Let z1 and z2 be arbitrary complex numbers. A directed line segment [z1 , z2 ] is
the path γ over [0, 1] defined by

γ (t) = (1 − t)z1 + tz2 ,

0 ≤ t ≤ 1.

(3.1.2)

Its initial point is γ (0) = z1 and its terminal point is γ (1) = z2 .

As the next example illustrates, there is definitely an advantage in using the complex notation, especially when the parametric representation of a curve involves
trigonometric functions.

Definition 3.1.4. If γ is a curve parametrized by the interval [a, b], the reverse of γ
is the curve γ ∗ parametrized by the same interval [a, b] and defined by

γ ∗ (t) = γ (b + a − t),

t ∈ [a, b].

(3.1.3)

The reverse of γ traces the same set of points as γ but in the opposite direction,
starting with γ ∗ (a) = γ (b) and ending with γ ∗ (b) = γ (a).

Example 3.1.5. Find the reverse of the directed line segment [z1 , z2 ].

3.1 Paths (Contours) in the Complex Plane

143

Solution. Using the parametrization for [z2 , z1 ] in Example 3.1.2(d) we find

γ ∗ (t) = γ (1 − t) = t z1 + (1 − t)z2 ,

0 ≤ t ≤ 1.

The curves in the preceding examples are all continuous, as can be seen from
their graphs, but these curves also have differentiability properties. In order to study
their differentiability, we investigate the derivative of a complex-valued function of
a real variable. This is unrelated to the derivative of a complex-valued function of a
complex variable.

Complex-Valued Functions of a Real Variable
Let f be a complex-valued function defined in an open interval (a, b). We define the
derivative of f in the usual way by
f  (t) =

f (t + h) − f (t)
d
f (t) = lim
.
h→0
dt
h

(3.1.4)

In view of Theorem 2.2.9, it follows that f  (t) exists if and only if ( Re f ) (t) and
( Im f ) (t) both exist, and in this case
f  (t) = ( Re f ) (t) + i ( Im f ) (t).

(3.1.5)

The derivative of a complex-valued function of a real variable satisfies many properties similar to those of the usual derivative of a real-valued function.
Proposition 3.1.6. Let f , g be complex-valued differentiable functions defined on an
open interval (a, b) and let α , β be complex numbers. Then for t ∈ (a, b) we have


α f + β g (t) = α f  (t) + β g (t),

f g (t) = f  (t) g(t) + g (t) f (t),



( f ◦ h) (t) = f  h(t) h (t),
t ∈ (a, b).
(3.1.9)
These rules can be verified by splitting the real and imaginary parts; we leave
their verification as an exercise.

In (3.1.9) we considered the chain rule for compositions of the form
R → R → C.
There is also a chain rule for compositions of the form
R → C → C,
where the second function is analytic. We examine this situation now.
Theorem 3.1.8. Suppose that x, y are differentiable functions defined on an interval
(a, b). Suppose that the function γ = x + iy takes values in a region U in the complex plane and that F is an analytic function on U. Then the function G = F ◦ γ is
differentiable on (a, b) and its derivative is
G (t) = F  (γ (t))γ  (t)

t ∈ (a, b).

(3.1.11)

Proof. Identifying F(γ (t)) with F(x(t), y(t)), we obtain the differentiability of G(t)
from Theorem 2.4.5. It remains to compute the derivative of G(t). Suppose F =
u + iv, where u, v are real-valued. Using Theorem 2.4.5 we write

Not all properties of the derivative of a real-valued function hold for complexvalued functions. Most notably, the mean value property fails for complex-valued
functions. For real-variable functions, the mean value property states that if f is
continuous on [a, b] and differentiable on (a, b), then f (b) − f (a) = f  (c)(b − a)
for some c in (a, b).
This property does not hold for
complex-valued functions. To see this,
consider f (x) = eix for x in [0, 2π ]. Then f
is continuous on [0, 2π ] and has a derivative f  (x) = i eix on (0, 2π ). Also,
f (2π ) − f (0) = 1 − 1 = 0,
but f  never vanishes since
| f  (x)| = |i eix | = |eix | = 1.
Hence there is no number c in (0, 2π )
such that f (2π ) − f (0) = (2π − 0) f  (c),
and so the mean value property does
not hold for complex-valued functions
(Figure 3.9).

Fig. 3.9 The mean value property fails for complex-valued
functions of a real variable.

Paths (Contours)
We introduce the notion of a path, which is fundamental in the theory of complex
integration. Recall that a curve already contains intrinsically the notion of continuity.
We now attach to it the fundamental analytical property of differentiability.
A continuous map f from [a, b] to C is called continuously differentiable if
it is also differentiable on [a, b] and its derivative f  is continuous on [a, b]. The
f (a)
derivative f  is defined at a and b as the one-sided limits f  (a) = limt↓a f (t)−
t−a
f (b)
and f  (b) = limt↑b f (t)−
. We extend this notion by allowing γ to have one-sided
t−b
derivatives at finitely many points in (a, b).

Definition 3.1.9. A continuous complex-valued function f defined on a closed
interval [a, b] is called piecewise continuously differentiable if there exist points
a1 < a2 < · · · < am−1 in (a, b) such that f  is continuously differentiable on each
interval [a j , a j+1 ] for j = 0, 1, . . . , m − 1, where a0 = a and am = b. In other words:
(i) f  (t) exists for all t in (a j , a j+1 ) and at the endpoints a j , a j+1 as one-sided limit.
(ii) f  is continuous on each interval [a j−1 , a j ] for j = 1, . . . , m.
Note that if f  is defined on [a, b], it may have jump discontinuities at some a j .

146

3 Complex Integration

Definition 3.1.10. A path or a contour is a curve γ defined a closed interval [a, b]
which is continuously differentiable or piecewise continuously differentiable. The
path γ is closed if γ (a) = γ (b).
Definition 3.1.11. Given points a0 < a1 < · · · < am and paths γ j on [a j−1 , a j ], j =
1, . . . , m, such that γ j (a j ) = γ j+1 (a j ) for all j = 1, . . . , m − 1, the combined path

Γ = [γ1 , . . . , γm ]
is piecewise defined on [a0 , am ] by Γ (t) = γ j (t) for t ∈ [a j−1 , a j ], j = 1, . . . , m.
Thus, according to Definitions 3.1.10 and 3.1.11, a path or a contour γ is a finite
sequence of continuously differentiable curves, γ1 , γ2 , . . . , γm , joined at the endpoints, i.e., γ = [γ1 , . . . , γm ]. The path γ is closed if the initial point of γ1 coincides
the terminal point of γm , i.e., γ1 (a0 ) = γm (am ).
Example 3.1.12. The path γ = [γ1 , γ2 , γ3 ] in Figure 3.10 consists of the curves:
The line segment γ1 = [−2, −1]; the semicircle γ2 ; and the line segment γ3 = [1, 2].
We can parametrize γ by the interval
[−2, 2] as follows:
⎧
if − 2 ≤ t ≤ −1,
⎨t
π
γ (t) = ei 2 (1−t) if − 1 ≤ t ≤ 1,
⎩
t
if 1 ≤ t ≤ 2.
The choice of the interval [−2, 2] as the
domain of definition was just for convenience. Other closed intervals can be used

to parametrize γ .

Example 3.1.13. (Polygonal paths) A polygonal path γ = [z1 , z2 , . . . , zn ] is the
union of the line segments [z1 , z2 ], [z2 , z3 ], . . ., [zn−1 , zn ]. This is a piecewise linear
path with initial point z1 and terminal point zn and may have self intersections.
A polygonal path is called simple if it does
not have self intersections, except possibly at
the endpoints, that is, z1 and zn may coincide.
The polygonal path is called closed if z1 = zn .
As an illustration, let z1 = 0, z2 = 1 + i, and
z3 = −1 + i; then γ = [z1 , z2 , z3 , z1 ] is a simple closed polygonal path. To find the equation of γ , we start by finding the equations of
the paths γ1 , γ2 , and γ3 , shown in Figure 3.11.
From Example 3.1.2(d), we have

γ1 (t) = (1 + i)t,
γ2 (t) = (1 − t)(1 + i) + t(−1 + i) = (1 + i) − 2t,
γ3 (t) = (1 − t)(−1 + i),

0 ≤ t ≤ 1;
0 ≤ t ≤ 1;
0 ≤ t ≤ 1.

We can now use these equations to parametrize γ over a closed interval, say [0, 1].
See Exercise 29.

The following example shows two interesting cases.
Example 3.1.14. (Degenerate and doubly traced paths)
(a) Describe the path of the curve γ (t) = z0 , a ≤ t ≤ b.
(b) Describe the path of γ2 (t) = Reit (R > 0), 0 ≤ t ≤ 4π , and discuss how it is
different from that of the curve γ1 (t) = Reit , 0 ≤ t ≤ 2π .
Solution. (a) As t ranges through the interval [a, b], the value of γ (t) remains fixed
at the point z0 . Clearly γ is continuous and γ  = 0 is also continuous, so γ is a path,
which has degenerated to a single point (Figure 3.12).

Fig. 3.12 A path that degenerates to a point.

Fig. 3.13 A doubly traced circle.

(b) Points on the path γ2 are on the circle of radius R, centered at the origin. As
t ranges from 0 to 4π , γ2 (t) goes around the circle twice. This path is shown in
Figure 3.13. One cannot automatically tell from the picture that the path is traced
twice and so we use double arrows to precisely indicate this fact, i.e., that the path
γ2 is traced twice in the indicated counterclockwise direction. The path γ1 traces
around the circle only once. The two paths have the same graph but γ2 has double

the length of γ1 .
As a convention, whenever we refer to a closed path, we mean the path that is
traversed only once, unless stated otherwise.
Example 3.1.15. (A curve that is not a path) Let f (t) = t 2 sin 1t for t = 0 and
f (0) = 0, and define a curve γ (t) = t + i f (t) for −π ≤ t ≤ π .

by the squeeze theorem. So f is continuous and differentiable on the closed intervals [−π , 0] and [0, π ] (with one-sided
limits at the endpoints). But f  is not continuous on [−π , 0] or on [0, π ]; thus, γ is
not a path. The graphs of f and f  are
shown in Figure 3.14.

Fig. 3.14 f is a differentiable
function but its derivative is not
continuous at a point. Thus the
graph of f is not a piecewise

3.2 Complex Integration
We begin by extending the definition of piecewise continuous functions to complexvalued functions.
Definition 3.2.1. A complex-valued function f defined on a closed interval [a, b] is
said to be piecewise continuous if there exist points a1 < a2 < · · · < am−1 in (a, b)
such that:
(i) f is continuous at every point in [a, b] \ {a1 , a2 , . . . , am−1 }.
(ii) The limits lim f (t) and lim f (t) exist and are finite for every j = 1, . . . , m − 1.

We now extend the notion of Riemann integral to complex-valued functions. We
assume from the theory of real variables that piecewise continuous real-valued func-

150

tions are Riemann integrable. Since piecewise continuous complex-valued functions
have piecewise continuous real and imaginary parts, they are also Riemann integrable.
Definition 3.2.2. Let f be a piecewise continuous function defined on an interval
[a, b] and taking values in the complex plane. We define the Riemann integral of f
as follows:
b

f (t) dt =

of these functions are well defined.
Note that as a consequence of this definition we have

that is, integration by parts holds as for real-valued functions.
Proof. Property (3.2.3) is immediate and is left to the reader. To prove (3.2.4), we
write f = f1 + i f2 , where f1 = Re f and f2 = Im f and β = β1 + iβ2 , with β1 , β2
real. Then β f = β1 f1 − β2 f2 + i(β1 f2 + β2 f1 ) . In view of Definition 3.2.2 we have

and this proves (3.2.4), hence (i). Property (3.2.5) is also reduced to the analogous

thus proving (3.2.6). The only inequality in (3.2.8) uses Re e−iθ f (t) ≤ |e−iθ f (t)|
and the monotonicity of the Riemann integral for real-valued functions.
Finally, we turn our attention to (iv). We write f = f1 + i f2 and g = g1 + ig2 ,
where f1 , f2 , g1 , g2 are real-valued. Then the left side of (3.2.7) is equal to

Antiderivatives of Complex-Valued Functions
Definition 3.2.5. If f is a piecewise continuous complex-valued function on [a, b],
we say that F is an antiderivative of f if F  = f at all the points of continuity of f
on (a, b). Hence if f = u + i v and F = U + iV , with u, v,U,V real-valued, then the
equalities U  (x) = u(x) and V  (x) = v(x) hold for all but finitely many x in (a, b).
We say that F is a continuous antiderivative of f , if F is an antiderivative of f and
it is a continuous function.

Fig. 3.18 An antiderivative of
a piecewise continuous function
may not be continuous.

Fig. 3.19 Selecting a continuous
antiderivative.

Using the previous notation, we write [a, b] as the finite union of adjacent closed
subintervals [a0 , a1 ], [a1 , a2 ], . . ., [am−1 , am ], with a0 = a and am = b, and such that
f is continuous on each subinterval. The functions U and V are continuous on each
subinterval and this makes F piecewise continuous on [a, b]. In general, F may not

3.2 Complex Integration

153

be continuous at the points a j (see Figure 3.18); but, as we show momentarily, a
continuous antiderivative can always be found.
Let f j denote the restriction of f to [a j−1 , a j ], and let Fj denote an antiderivative
of f j over [a j−1 , a j ]. Each Fj is computed up to an arbitrary complex constant, which
can be determined in such a way to make F continuous.
Start by setting the arbitrary constant in F1 equal 0. Then determine the constant in F2 so that limx↑a1 F1 (x) = limx↓a1 F2 (x). (We use the up-arrow to denote
a limit from the left and the down-arrow a limit from the right.) This determines
F2 and makes the antiderivative of f continuous on [a, a2 ]. Continue in this fashion: Once we have found Fj , determine the constant in Fj+1 so that limx↑a j Fj (x) =
limx↓a j Fj+1 (x). By construction, the resulting function F will be continuous on
[a, b] (see Figure 3.19). The following example illustrates the method.

The following is an extension of the fundamental theorem of calculus to piecewise continuous complex functions.

Proof. Let f = u + i v where u = Re f and v = Im f . Suppose first that f is continuous on [a, b]. Let F = U + iV be an antiderivative of f . Using (3.2.1) and the
fundamental theorem of calculus, we see that

and hence (3.2.10) holds.
Let a1 < a2 < · · · < am−1 be the points of discontinuity of a piecewise continuous
function f in the open interval (a, b). We use (3.2.5) and the previous case to write

which proves (3.2.10).

As an application of Theorem 3.2.7, we evaluate the integral in Example 3.2.4
using the continuous antiderivative that we found in Example 3.2.6. In the notation
of Example 3.2.6, we have

It is easy to show that two continuous antiderivatives of f differ by a complex
constant on [a, b]. Motivated by Theorem 3.2.7, we write
f (t) dt = F(t) +C

(3.2.11)

to denote any continuous antiderivative of f ; here C is an arbitrary complex constant. For example, if z = 0 is a complex number, then

(3.2.12)

as can be checked by verifying that the derivative of the right side is equal to the
integrand on the left side. This simple integral of a complex-valued function has an
interesting application to the evaluation of certain integrals from calculus.

We now have all the tools that we need to construct the integral along a path in
the complex plane.

Path or Contour Integrals
We discuss how to define the integral of continuous complex-valued functions over
paths.
Definition 3.2.9. (Path Integral or Contour Integral) Suppose that γ is a path over
a closed interval [a, b] and that f is a continuous complex-valued function defined
on the graph of γ . The path or contour integral of f on γ is defined as:

γ

We now give examples of path integrals, starting with one of great importance.

Solution. (a) Parametrize CR (z0 )

Then γ  (t) = iReit and, for z =

In particular, if C1 (0) denotes the positively oriented unit circle with center at the
origin, then (3.2.16) and (3.2.17) imply that

and

C1 (0)

Compare (3.2.18) with the following integrals involving z.

and the following observations. On C1 (0), z = eit , z = eit = e−it = 1z . Thus, by

The path integral has many properties similar to the Riemann integral. We list

f and g are continuous functions on γ , and α and β are complex numbers. Then we

then

(3.2.22)

Proof. (i) This property follows by expressing the path integrals as Riemann integrals via (3.2.15) and then applying (3.2.3) and (3.2.4).
(ii) Recall the parametrization of the reverse of γ from (3.1.3): γ ∗ (t) = γ (b + a − t),
where t runs over the same interval [a, b] that parametrizes γ . Then
(γ ∗ ) (t) = −γ  (b + a − t) .
Changing variables τ = b + a − t, dt = −d τ and using (3.2.15), we obtain

Solution. Let γ1 be a parametrization of
[z1 , z2 ], γ2 be a parametrization of [z2 , z3 ],
and γ3 be a parametrization of [z3 , z1 ].
There are several possible ways to compute γ1 , γ2 and γ3 . To be consistent with
earlier notation we use (3.1.2). Accordingly, for 0 ≤ t ≤ 1 we have

γ1 (t) = −(1 − t) + t = −1 + 2t
γ2 (t) = 1 − t + it
γ3 (t) = (1 − t)i − t = −t + i (1 − t),

z2 = 1, z3 = i.

and these imply that

γ1 (t) = 2,

(3.2.26)

Parts (d) and (f) show that the integral of z over a path that joins z1 to z3 depends on
the path.

Under what conditions is the path integral independent of the path? We address
this important question in the next section. Another question that comes to mind
as we work with path integrals concerns the parametrization of the path. Since a
path may be parametrized in many different ways, is the integral independent of the
choice of the parametrization?
Example 3.2.15. The positively oriented unit circle C1 (0) can be parametrized by
γ1 (s) = eis , 0 ≤ s ≤ 2π or γ2 (t) = e2π it , 0 ≤ t ≤ 1. If f is a continuous function on
C1 (0), show that γ1 f (z) dz = γ2 f (z) dz.
Solution. Using the definition of path integrals and a simple change of variables
s = 2π t, ds = 2π dt, we have
γ2

f (z) dz =

1
0

f (e2π it )2π ie2π it dt =

2π
0

f (eis )ieis ds =

γ1

f (z) dz.

The same proof works in general, but we have to explain what we mean by two
parametrizations being the same. To do so, we need to recall the notion of a continuously differentiable map. A map from [a, b] to R is called continuously differentiable
if it is continuous on [a, b] and has a continuous derivative on (a, b).
Definition 3.2.16. We say that the paths γ1 (t), a ≤ t ≤ b, and γ2 (s), c ≤ s ≤ d, have
equivalent parametrizations if there is a strictly increasing continuously differentiable function φ from [c, d] onto [a, b] such that φ (c) = a and φ (d) = b and
γ2 (s) = γ1 ◦ φ (s) for all s in [c, d], or equivalently γ1 (t) = γ2 ◦ φ −1 (t) for all t ∈ [a, b],
where φ −1 is the unique inverse of φ .
Notice that the range of paths with equivalent parametrizations is the same. Moreover, the orientation of the trajectories of both paths is the same. Using this terminology, the two parametrizations of Example 3.2.15 are equivalent.
The next result confirms a property that we would expect from a path integral.
Proposition 3.2.17. (Independence of Parametrization) Suppose that the paths
γ1 (t), a ≤ t ≤ b, and γ2 (s), c ≤ s ≤ d, have equivalent parametrizations and let f be
a continuous function on this path. Then
γ1

f (z) dz =

γ2

f (z) dz.

(3.2.27)

Proof. We have γ2 = γ1 ◦ φ , where φ is an increasing continuously differentiable
function from [c, d] onto [a, b]. Assume first that γ1 is differentiable at every point
on (a, b). Then so is γ2 = γ1 ◦ φ on (c, d). Applying the definition of path integrals,

3.2 Complex Integration

161

and using γ2 (s) = γ1 (φ (s)) and γ2 (s) = γ1 (φ (s))φ  (s), we change variables t = φ (s)
or s = φ −1 (t), with dt = φ  (s) ds, to obtain
d
c

f (γ2 (s))γ2 (s) ds =

d
c

f (γ1 (φ (s)))γ1 (φ (s))φ  (s) ds =

b
a

f (γ1 (t))γ1 (t) dt ,

or equivalently, (3.2.27) holds in this case.
It remains to consider the case where γ1 is not differentiable at some points
a1 < · · · < am−1 in (a, b), as in Definition 3.1.9. Set a0 = a and am = b. Then γ1 is differentiable at every point on (a j , a j+1 ) for j = 0, . . . , m − 1. Noting that c = φ −1 (a0 )
and d = φ −1 (am ), the preceding case gives
φ −1 (a j+1 )
φ −1 (a j )

f (γ2 (s))γ2 (s) ds =

a j+1
aj

f (γ1 (t))γ1 (t) dt,

and summing over j in {0, 1, . . . , m − 1}, we deduce
φ −1 (b)
φ −1 (a)

f (γ2 (s))γ2 (s) ds =

b
a

f (γ1 (t))γ1 (t) dt ,


which is just a restatement of (3.2.27).

Arc Length and Bounds for Integrals
Write a smooth path γ : [a, b] → C as γ = x+i y, where x, y are real-valued functions.
The length of γ , denoted (γ ), can be approximated by adding the length of line
segments joining consecutive points on the graph of γ as in Figure 3.22. The sum of
the lengths of the line segments is
m

∑ |γ (tk ) − γ (tk−1 )| =

k=1

m

∑



|x(tk ) − x(tk−1 )|2 + |y(tk ) − y(tk−1 )|2 ,

(3.2.28)

k=1

where a = t0 < t1 < t2 < · · · < tm = b is a partition of [a, b].
Thus the length of γ is the limit (when
it exists) of the sums on the right side of
(3.2.28) as the partition of [a, b] gets finer
and finer. To find this limit, we use the
mean value theorem and write
|x(tk ) − x(tk−1 )|2 = |x (αk )(tk − tk−1 )|2
and
|y(tk ) − y(tk−1 )|2 = |y (βk )(tk − tk−1 )|2 ,

length of a path by adding the
length of line segments.

where αk and βk are in [tk−1 ,tk ]. Then (3.2.28) becomes


m

∑

|x (αk )|2 + |y (βk )|2 (tk − tk−1 ).

k=1

Recognizing this sum as a Riemann sum and taking limits as the partition gets finer,
we recover the formula for arc length from calculus:
(γ ) =

a

|x (t)|2 + |y (t)|2 dt =

where the
 second equality follows from the complex notation γ (t) = x (t) + i y (t)


2

2
and so |x (t)| + |y (t)| = |γ (t)|.
For a piecewise smooth path γ , we repeat the preceding analysis for each smooth
piece γ j of γ and then add the lengths (γ j )’s. Definition 3.1.9 guarantees that each
γ j has a continuous derivative on the subinterval [a j , a j+1 ] on which it is defined;
thus, (γ j ) is finite, hence so is (γ ). This process yields formula (3.2.29) for the
arc length of a piecewise smooth path γ as well, where the integrand in this case is
piecewise continuous. The element of arc length is usually denoted by ds. Thus,

(3.2.30)
ds = |x (t)|2 + |y (t)|2 dt.

Example 3.2.18. (Arc length of cycloid) Let a > 0. Find the length of the arch of
the cycloid γ (t) = a(t − sint)+ i a(1− cost), where t ranges over the interval [0, 2π ].
The curve, illustrated in Figure 3.23, is
formed by the trace of a fixed point on
a moving circle that completes a full
rotation.
Fig. 3.23 First arch of the cycloid.

Solution. We have
x(t) = a(t − sint) ⇒ x (t) = a(1 − cost);
y(t) = a (1 − cost) ⇒ y (t) = a sint.
Hence

We have a similar inequality for path integrals, called the ML–inequality.
Theorem 3.2.19. (Bounds for Path Integrals) Suppose that γ is a path with length
(γ ), and f is a continuous function on γ such that | f (z)| ≤ M for all z on γ . Then

γ

f (z) dz ≤ M (γ ).

| f (γ (t))| |γ  (t)| dt ≤ M

using property (3.2.6) and the fact that | f (z)| ≤ M for all z on γ .

smooth. Then

the lengths of its parts.

1

C1 (0)

e z dz ≤ 2π M,

where M is an upper bound of |e z | for z on the unit circle. To find M we proceed as
follows. For z on C1 (0), write z = eit where 0 ≤ t ≤ 2π . Then

and so, for z = eit ,

e z = ecost−i sint = ecost e−i sint = ecost ≤ e1 = e.
(In setting e−i sint = 1 we have used |eis | = 1 for real s.) Thus
1

C1 (0)

e z dz ≤ 2π e.

Using techniques of integration from Chapter 5, we can evaluate the integral and
1
obtain C1 (0) e z dz = 2π i. Thus the bound that we obtained by applying (3.2.31) is
correct but not best possible, since |2π i| = 2π is the best upper bound.

The path described by γ (t) = t for t in [a, b] is the closed interval [a, b]. For such
a path, we have γ  (t) dt = dt, and if f is a function defined on γ , the path integral
(3.2.15) becomes
γ

f (z) dz =

b
a

f (t) dt,

showing that a Riemann integral of a piecewise continuous complex-valued function
over [a, b] is a special case of a path integral, where the path is the line segment
[a, b]. So results about path integrals apply, in particular, to Riemann integrals.

3.3 Independence of Paths
In calculus, the problem of computing a definite integral over an interval was
often reduced to finding an antiderivative and evaluating it at the endpoints. This
is achieved by the fundamental theorem of calculus which says that if g is a continuous function on an interval [a, b] and G is an antiderivative of g on (a, b), then
b
a

g(t) dt = G(b) − G(a).

In this section, we investigate an analogous way to compute path integrals.
Definition 3.3.1. Let f be a continuous function on a region Ω . We say that F is
an antiderivative of f in Ω if F is an analytic function on Ω with the property
F  (z) = f (z) for all z in Ω .
Since f is continuous, F is analytic and, in particular, it is continuous. Moreover,
any two antiderivatives of f differ by a constant, as a consequence of Theorem 2.5.7.
To find an antiderivative of a continuous function f we try, if possible, to guess
our answer based on formulas from calculus. For example, if f (z) = z ez , we guess
the antiderivative F(z) = z ez − ez . Then we can verify this guess by differentiation.
As the following examples illustrate, part of checking the answer is to make sure
that the antiderivative is analytic on the domain of definition.

Example 3.3.2. (Antiderivatives)
4
(a) An antiderivative of f (z) = z3 + 7 z − 2 is F(z) = z4 + 72 z2 − 2z, and the identity
F  (z) = f (z) holds for all z in C.
(b) The function f (z) = Log z is continuous for z in C \ (−∞, 0]. An antiderivative
is F(z) = z Log z − z, and the identity F  (z) = f (z) holds for all z in C \ (−∞, 0].
(c) The function f (z) = 1z is continuous in C \ {0}. We may guess an antiderivative
F(z) = Log z. But the equality F  (z) = f (z) holds for all z in C \ (−∞, 0]. So Log z
is an antiderivative of 1z in C \ (−∞, 0] only, even though f is continuous in C \ {0}.
(d) Let Ωα denote the region C minus the ray at angle α , and let logα z denote the
branch of the logarithm with a branch cut at angle α . In view of the discussion after
Example 2.5.5, logα z is analytic in Ωα
and
d
1
logα z = ,
dz
z
for all z in Ωα . Thus F(z) = logα z is an
antiderivative of 1z in Ωα . In particular, if
we choose α in such a way that the ray
at angle α is not the negative x-axis, then
F(z) = logα z becomes an antiderivative
of 1z in a region that contains the negative
x-axis. See Figure 3.24.
Thus antiderivatives of

1
z

Fig. 3.24 logα z and its branch
cut at angle α .

can be found on all regions Ωα .



We now show that we can use antiderivatives to evaluate path integrals much like
we used antiderivatives in calculus to evaluate definite integrals. We achieve this
goal via an important theorem; before stating it we need the following lemma.
Lemma 3.3.3. Suppose that f is a continuous function in a region Ω that contains
an open disk Br (z) for some z ∈ Ω and some r > 0. Then for |w| < r the line segment
[z, z + w] is contained in Ω and we have
1
w→0 w
lim

[z, z+w]

f (ζ ) d ζ = f (z).

(3.3.1)

Proof. Parametrize [z, z + w] by γ (t) = (1 −t)z +t(z + w) = z +tw, where 0 ≤ t ≤ 1.
Then γ  (t) = w dt and so
1
w

[z,z+w]

f (ζ ) d ζ =

1
0

f (z + tw) dt.

Given ε > 0, by the continuity of f , there is a δ > 0 (with δ < r) such that
|w| < δ =⇒ | f (z + w) − f (z)| < ε .

(3.3.2)

3.3 Independence of Paths

169

If |w| < δ , we have |tw| < δ for all t ∈ [0, 1] and thus | f (z + tw) − f (z)| < ε . From
the ML-inequality (3.2.31), we obtain for |w| < δ
1
0

f (z + tw) dt − f (z) =

1
0

[ f (z + tw) − f (z)] dt ≤

1
0

| f (z +tw) − f (z)| dt ≤ ε

and (3.3.1) follows using (3.3.2) by the (ε , δ ) definition of the limit.



We are now able to prove the main result of this section.
Theorem 3.3.4. (Independence of Path) Let f be a continuous complex-valued
function on a region Ω . Then the following assertions are equivalent:
(a) There is an analytic function F on Ω such that f (z) = F  (z) for all z in Ω .
(b) For arbitrary points z1 , z2 and any path γ in Ω that joins z1 to z2 , the integral
I=

γ

f (z) dz

is independent of the path γ .
(c) The integral of f over all closed paths is zero.
Moreover, if (a) holds,1 then for any path γ in Ω that joins z1 and z2 we have
γ

f (z) dz = F(z2 ) − F(z1 ).

(3.3.3)

Proof. If F is an antiderivative of f in Ω , then the complex-valued function t →
F(γ (t)) is differentiable at the points t in (a, b) where γ  (t) exists and we have
d
F(γ (t)) = F  (γ (t))γ  (t) = f (γ (t))γ  (t)
dt

(3.3.4)

in view of Theorem 3.1.8. Now t → f (γ (t))γ  (t) is piecewise continuous, because f
is continuous and γ  is piecewise continuous. Also, since F ◦ γ is continuous, (3.3.4)
tells us that F ◦ γ is a continuous antiderivative of ( f ◦ γ ) γ  , in the sense of Theorem
3.2.7. Using this theorem, we deduce

γ

f (z) dz =

b
a

f (γ (t))γ  (t) dt = F(γ (b)) − F(γ (a)) = F(z2 ) − F(z1 ),

completing the proof that (a) implies (b) and simultaneously deriving (3.3.3).
We now show that (b) implies (a). We only need to show that if I is independent
of path, then f has an antiderivative F. Fix z0 in Ω . For z in Ω , define
F(z) =
1

and thus if (b) or (c) hold

γ (z0 ,z)

f (ζ ) d ζ ,

(3.3.5)

170

3 Complex Integration

where γ (z0 , z) is a path joining z0 to z. Such a path exists since Ω is polygonally
connected and the function in (3.3.5) is well defined in view of the property that the
integral is independent of path.
Since Ω is open and z ∈ Ω , there is an open disk Br (z) centered at z which is
entirely contained in Ω . For z + w in Br (z), the line segment [z, z + w] lies in Ω .
Since the integral of f is independent
of path, we do not choose an arbitrary
path that joins z0 to z + w but we choose
the path


γ (z0 , z + w) = γ (z0 , z), [z, z + w] ,
fomed by the path γ (z0 , z) followed by
the line segment [z, z + w], as shown in
Figure 3.25.
Fig. 3.25 Picture of the proof.

Then, in view of Proposition 3.2.12 (iii), we have
γ (z0 ,z+w)

f (ζ ) d ζ =

γ (z0 ,z)

f (ζ ) d ζ +

[z,z+w]

f (ζ ) d ζ

and so
F(z + w) − F(z) =
Then,

γ (z0 ,z+w)

f (ζ ) d ζ −

F(z + w) − F(z)

=
w
w

γ (z0 ,z)

f (ζ ) d ζ =

[z, z+w]

[z,z+w]

f (ζ ) d ζ .

f (ζ ) d ζ .

(3.3.6)

Taking the limit as w → 0 and appealing to Lemma 3.3.3, we obtain that the function
F has a complex derivative at z and F  (z) = f (z).
Finally, it remains to prove the equivalence of (b) and (c). To see this, consider
the closed path γ in Figure 3.26 containing the point z1 .

Fig. 3.26 A closed path starting
and ending at the same point z1 .

Fig. 3.27 γ1 followed by γ2∗ .

3.3 Independence of Paths

171

If we start at z1 and trace γ until, we return to z1 , by (3.3.3) we obtain
γ

f (z) dz = F(z1 ) − F(z1 ) = 0.

Hence, if f has an analytic antiderivative, its integral over any closed path is zero.
Conversely, suppose we know that the integral of f around every closed path is
zero. Consider the two paths γ1 and γ2 joining z1 to z2 in Figure 3.27, and let Γ be
the closed path consisting of γ1 followed by γ2∗ , the reverse of γ2 . Then
0=

Γ

f (z) dz =

γ1

f (z) dz +

γ2 ∗

f (z) dz =

γ1

f (z) dz −

γ2

f (z) dz,

implying that γ1 f (z) dz = γ2 f (z) dz. Thus, the integral of f is independent of path.
In conclusion, the integral of f is independent of path in a region Ω if and only if

the integral of f over an arbitrary closed path in Ω is 0.
Thus, in view of Theorem 3.3.4, to compute a path integral of a function whose
antiderivative is known, we may ignore the path and evaluate the integral using the
endpoints. Here are some applications.

In Example 3.3.2, the region that contained the paths was of little concern,
because the integrands and their antiderivatives were entire. This is not the case
in the next two examples, where the domain of the antiderivative must be carefully
chosen.

where [z1 , z2 , z3 ] is the polygonal path with z1 = 1, z2 = 2 + i, z3 = 3 (Figure 3.31).

is Log z in the region Ω = C \ (−∞, 0].
The path [z1 , z2 , z3 ] lies entirely in Ω , see
Figure 3.31. We apply Theorem 3.3.4 to
obtain

where [z1 , z2 , z3 ] is the polygonal path with z1 = −1, z2 = −1 + i, z3 = −4 − 4i (see
Figure 3.32).

3.3 Independence of Paths

173

Solution. In order to apply Theorem 3.3.4, we must find an antiderivative of 1z that is analytic in a region that
contains the path [z1 , z2 , z3 ]. We cannot
use Log z as antiderivative, because it is
not analytic in a region that contains the
path [z1 , z2 , z3 ]. Instead, we will use a different branch of the logarithm. We know
from Example 3.3.2(d) that logα z is an
antiderivative of 1z in the region Ωα (C
minus the ray at angle α ). Choose α in
such a way that the branch cut of logα z
does not intersect the path [z1 , z2 , z3 ].
Taking, for example, α = 0 we write

Fig. 3.32 Picture for Example 3.3.7.

log0 z = ln |z| + i arg0 z,
where 0 < arg0 z ≤ 2π . By Theorem 3.3.4 we have
[z1 , z2 , z3 ]

dz = log0 (z3 ) − log0 (z1 )

Integrals over Closed Paths
We now turn to applications of Theorem 3.3.4 related to integrals over closed paths.
We start with some straightforward ones.
Example 3.3.8. (Integrals over closed paths)
(a) Since z2 /2 is an antiderivative of z on the plane, if γ is a closed path, then by
Theorem 3.3.4,
z dz = 0.

(b) Likewise,

for all z in the plane.

(c) Let C 1 (0) denote the positively ori2

ented circle with center at 0 and radius 12 .
Then, by Theorem 3.3.4,
1
dz = 0,
C 1 (0) 1 + z
2

because Log (1 + z) is an antideriva1
in the region C \ (−∞, −1],
tive of z+1
which contains C 1 (0). The branch cut of
2
Log (z + 1) is obtained by translating to
the left by one unit the branch cut of
Log z. See Figure 3.33.

(d) Let C 1 (z0 ) be a positively oriented closed circle of radius 1/2 centered at z0 and

C 1 (z0 )

1
dz = 2π i = 0,
z − z0

2



which is a contradiction.

The next example is somewhat surprising. In calculus, if g is a continuous
function on a closed interval [a, b], then it has an antiderivative; namely, G(x) =
x
a g(t) dt. This is not the case in complex analysis, as the next example shows.
Example 3.3.9. (A continuous function with no antiderivative)
(a) Let R be a positive real number and CR (z0 ) the positively oriented circle, centered
at z0 , with radius R. Evaluate
CR (z0 )

z − z0 dz.

(b) Prove that f (z) = z has no antiderivative on any region.
Solution. (a) Parametrize CR (z0 ) by z = z0 + Reit , where 0 ≤ t ≤ 2π . Then dz =
Rieit dt and
z − z0 = z0 + Reit − z0 = Reit = Re−it ,

3.3 Independence of Paths

175

so we have
CR (z0 )

z − z0 dz =

2π
0

Re−it Rieit dt = R2 i

2π
0

dt = 2π iR2 .

(b) The proof is by contradiction. Assume to the contrary that f (z) = z has an
antiderivative F in some region Ω and let z0 be a point in Ω . Then, we check directly
that F(z) − z0 z is an antiderivative of z − z0 = z − z0 . Let R > 0 be such that CR (z0 )
is contained in Ω . By Theorem 3.3.4(c) , the integral of z − z0 over CR (z0 ) is 0,
which contradicts the outcome of the calculation in part (a). Hence the assumption

that there is an antiderivative of z − z0 must be false.
While Theorem 3.3.4 is very useful, it has limited applications when it comes
to the evaluation of general integrals. For example, while it is immediate that the
integral of ez over a closed path is zero (ez is an antiderivative of itself), it is not
2
clear whether the same is true for the function ez , since we do not know whether it
has an antiderivative. It is desirable to have a result that would enable us to compute
integrals of analytic functions over closed paths without resorting to antiderivatives.
In the next section we prove one such result, called Cauchy’s theorem; this is at the
heart of the theory of path integrals and indeed all of complex analysis.

3.4 Cauchy’s Integral Theorem for Simple Paths

177

3.4 Cauchy’s Integral Theorem for Simple Paths
In this section, we prove Cauchy’s theorem for analytic functions, assuming continuity of their derivatives. This version is not the most general available but is sufficient for concrete applications where the derivative is explicit. Versions of this result
without assuming continuity of derivatives can be found in subsequent sections.

Simple Curves and Green’s Theorem
Definition 3.4.1. A curve is called simple if it does not intersect itself except possibly at the endpoints. In other words, if γ is parametrized by [a, b] and a ≤ t1 < t2 ≤ b,
then γ is a simple curve if γ (t1 ) = γ (t2 ) whenever t1 = t2 . A simple closed curve
is both simple and closed; i.e., it intersects itself only at the endpoints; that is, if
a ≤ t1 < t2 ≤ b, then γ (t1 ) = γ (t2 ) if and only if t1 = a and t2 = b. A simple curve
that is also a path (see Definition 3.1.10) is called a simple path.
A simple closed curve can loop around and look very complicated, but it cannot
cross itself. A simple closed curve is also called a Jordan curve, after the French
mathematician Camille Jordan (1838–1922), who showed that a simple closed curve
γ divides the plane into two regions: a bounded region, called the interior of γ , and
an unbounded region, called the exterior of γ .
In Figure 3.34 the region D is the interior and U is the exterior. This is the
famous Jordan curve theorem from
topology, which is easy to picture but
quite difficult to prove. A proof can be
found in The Jordan curve theorem,
formally and informally, Amer. Math.
Monthly 114 (10), (2007), 882–894,
by Thomas C. Hales.

Fig. 3.34 A Jordan path γ and
the interior domain D and the
exterior domain U.

Since the interior and the exterior regions relative to a simple closed curve are
identifiable, we may define positive and negative orientations of such a curve. The
positive orientation of a simple closed curve is the one that places the interior
region to our left when traced; see Figure 3.35. The negative orientation is the
one that, when traced, places the interior region to our right; see Figure 3.36. Our
definition of positive versus negative orientation thus generalizes our earlier idea of
counterclockwise versus clockwise orientation of circles.

We now recall an important result from advanced calculus concerning line integrals over simple paths. This theorem bears the name of the British Mathematician
George Green (1793–1841).

(3.4.1)

The integral on the right side of (3.4.1) is a double integral over the region D. To
understand the notation in the line integral on the left side of (3.4.1), parametrize
γ by x = x(t) and y = y(t), where a ≤ t ≤ b. Then the integral on the left side of
(3.4.1) means

2 dx dy = 2 × (Area of D).

For example, if γ is the unit circle with positive orientation, then the integral is equal

to 2 × (Area of unit disk) = 2π .
We apply Green’s theorem to evaluate path integrals of the form γ f (z) dz where
γ is a simple closed path and f is an analytic function on γ and the region interior
to γ . For this purpose, parametrize γ by γ (t) = x(t) + i y(t), where a ≤ t ≤ b, and
write f (z) = u(x, y) + i v(x, y), where u and v are the real and imaginary parts of f ,
respectively. Then, by the definition of path integrals, we write

(3.4.2)

Thus the path integral γ f (z) dz is equal to a complex linear combination of two line
integrals of real-valued functions. To remember (3.4.2), starting with γ f (z) dz, we
use f (z) = u + iv and dz = dx + i dy as follows:
γ

f (z) dz =

γ

(u + iv)(dx + idy) =

γ

(u dx − v dy) + i

γ

(v dx + u dy).

We now state the main result of this section.
Theorem 3.4.4. (Cauchy’s Theorem for Simple Paths) Suppose that f is an analytic function on a region U that contains a simple closed path γ and its interior. If
f  is continuous on U, then we have
γ

f (z) dz = 0.

(3.4.3)

Remark 3.4.5. We later prove that derivatives of analytic functions are also analytic, hence continuous (Corollary 3.8.9). Thus the assumption that f  is continuous
in Theorem 3.4.4 is superfluous. The merit of Theorem 3.4.4 lies in the fact that all
analytic functions we encounter in examples have continuous derivatives.
Proof. Recall that if f = u + iv, u, v real-valued, then f  = ux + ivx = uy + ivy in view
of (2.5.8), and the Cauchy-Riemann equations (2.5.7) hold: ux = vy and uy = −vx .
Using (3.4.2) and then applying Green’s theorem along with the Cauchy-Riemann
equations, we write

This completes the proof of the theorem.

Remark 3.4.6. It is very crucial in Theorem 3.4.4 for the domain U of f to contain
all points in the interior of the curve γ . Indeed, the function 1z is analytic and has
a continuous derivative except at the origin. Thus the domain of 1/z does not contain the interior of the unit circle C1 (0). And we showed in Example 3.2.10, that
1
C1 (0) z dz = 2π i = 0.

3.5 The Cauchy-Goursat Theorem
Our next goal is to prove Cauchy’s theorem without assuming that the derivative of
the analytic function is continuous. This requires an effort and occupies this and the
next section. In this section we prove this theorem only for special kinds of sets,
called star-shaped.
The fact that an analytic function has a complex derivative at a point means that
near this point it can be approximated by a linear function. Since linear functions
have antiderivatives and thus vanishing integral over closed paths, it follows that
the integral of the analytic function over every closed triangle is small. This argument can be made precise and is the foundation of the proof of the general form of
Cauchy’s theorem. By a closed triangle we mean the interior and the perimeter of a
triangle. For a closed triangle  we set Diam() to be the diameter of a triangle,

182

3 Complex Integration

i.e., the length of its longest side, and we denote by ∂ Δ its boundary, i.e., the union
of the three line segments joining its vertices.
Lemma 3.5.1. Let f be a continuous function on an open set U in C and assume
that f  (z0 ) exists for some z0 in U. Then for ε > 0 there is δ > 0 such that for every
closed triangle  that contains z0 with  ⊂ Bδ (z0 ) ∩U we have
∂


2
f (z) dz < ε Diam() .

(3.5.1)

Proof. Let ε > 0. Since f has a complex derivative f  (z0 ) at z0 , there is δ > 0 such
that Bδ (z0 ) is contained in U and for all z ∈ Bδ (z0 ) we have
f (z) − f (z0 )

f (z0 )z + 12 f  (z0 )(z − z0 )2 . Since Δ is contained in Bδ (z0 ) it follows that for z ∈ ∂ Δ
we have |z − z0 | < δ ; hence, using (3.5.3) and (3.5.2) we obtain

f (z) dz =

We use this lemma to obtain the fundamental result that analytic functions have
vanishing integral over boundaries of closed triangles contained in their domains.

3.5 The Cauchy-Goursat Theorem

183

This theorem is attributed to Cauchy and the French mathematician Édouard Goursat (1858–1936).
Theorem 3.5.2. (Cauchy-Goursat Theorem) Suppose that  is a closed triangle
contained in a region U and let f be an analytic function on U. Let ∂  denote the
boundary of  with positive orientation. Then we have
∂

f (z) dz = 0 .

(3.5.5)

Proof. We show that ∂  f (z) dz is zero by showing that ∂  f (z) dz < ε for all
ε > 0. Thus, we fix ε > 0.
We begin by subdividing the triangle  into four closed triangles 1 , 2 , 3 ,
4 of size 1/4 of that of  by joining the midpoints of the sides of . (See Figure 3.37). Assume that the boundaries of  j are positively oriented. Then we have
∂

f (z) dz =

∂ 1

f (z) dz +

∂ 2

f (z) dz +

∂ 3

f (z) dz +

∂ 4

f (z) dz ,

since the contributions of the integrals over the line segments joining the midpoints
of  cancel. Therefore we obtain
∂

f (z) dz ≤

∂ 1

f (z) dz +

∂ 2

f (z) dz +

∂ 3

f (z) dz +

∂ 4

f (z) dz ,

and so there is a triangle among 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , which we call 1 , such that
∂ 1

f (z) dz ≥

1
4

∂

f (z) dz .

We now repeat the above procedure by replacing  by 1 . Then we find a closed
triangle 2 of size 1/4 of that of 1 such that

The collection {n }∞
n=1 is a nested sequence of nonempty closed and bounded
(compact) sets and by the nonempty intersection property (Appendix, p. 484), there
is a point z0 in their intersection. This point is shown in Figure 3.38.
We now apply Lemma 3.5.1. Since f has a complex derivative at z0 , for the
number ε /(Diam())2 there is a δ > 0 such that Bδ (z0 ) ⊂ U and such that the
integral of f over the boundary of any closed triangle containing z0 and contained in
Bδ (z0 ) is at most ε /(Diam())2 . There is n large enough such that n is contained

Cauchy’s Theorem for Star-shaped Domains
A subset V of the complex plane C is called convex if for all a, b ∈ V we have
(1 − t)a + tb ∈ V

for all t ∈ [0, 1].

Geometrically speaking, convex sets contain all closed line segments whose endpoints lie in the set. For instance, interiors of open or closed squares and balls are
convex sets. The notion of star-shaped sets extends that of convex sets.
Definition 3.5.3. A subset V of the complex plane C is called star-shaped about a
point z0 in V if for all z ∈ V we have
(1 − t)z0 + tz ∈ V

for all t ∈ [0, 1].

3.5 The Cauchy-Goursat Theorem

185

In other words, star-shaped sets contain all closed line segments starting from a
fixed point z0 and ending at an arbitrary point in the set. See Figure 3.39. Convex
sets are always star-shaped about any point in them, but the converse is not true.

Fig. 3.39 These non-convex regions are star-shaped regions about the points indicated by dots.

Theorem 3.5.4. Suppose that V is an open star-shaped subset of the plane and let
f be an analytic function on V . Then for a simple closed path γ contained in V we
have
f (z) dz = 0 .
(3.5.7)
γ

Proof. Fix a point z0 in V such that [z0 , z] lie in V for all z ∈ V . Define the function
F(z) =

[z0 ,z]

f (ζ ) d ζ ,

for z ∈ V.

Since the line segment is contained in V , the function F is well defined. We show
that F has a complex derivative equal to f . Let z ∈ V and let δ > 0 be such that
Bδ (z) is contained in V . Then the closed triangle [z0 , z, z + h, z0 ] is contained in V
and Theorem 3.5.2 yields
[z0 ,z,z+h,z0 ]

f (ζ ) d ζ = 0.

In view of Properties (3.2.21) and (3.2.22) we have for h ∈ Bδ (0)
[z0 ,z]

thus

f (ζ ) d ζ +

[z,z+h]

f (ζ ) d ζ −

F(z + h) − F(z) 1

[z0 ,z+h]

[z,z+h]

f (ζ ) d ζ = 0,

f (ζ ) d ζ .

Letting h → 0 and using Lemma 3.3.3, we conclude that F has a complex derivative
at any point z in V and F  (z) = f (z). Then by Theorem 3.3.4, the integral of f around

an arbitrary closed path γ contained in V is zero.

3.6 Cauchy Integral Theorem For Simply Connected Regions

187

3.6 Cauchy Integral Theorem For Simply Connected Regions
In this section we extend Cauchy’s theorem from star-shaped sets to general regions.
The approach we take is based on the geometric concept of deformation of paths
that is easy to visualize, as illustrated by many examples. A precise definition is
motivated by the following three cases:
• Suppose that α and β are points in a region Ω , and γ0 and γ1 are paths in Ω
joining α to β . This means that the initial point of both γ0 and γ1 is α while the
terminal point of both γ0 and γ1 is β . It may be possible to move γ0 continuously
so that it coincides with γ1 , keeping the ends fixed at α and β and without leaving
Ω (Figure 3.40).
• If γ0 and γ1 are two closed paths in a region Ω , it may be possible to continuously
move γ0 without leaving Ω , in such a way that it coincides with γ1 in position
and direction (Figure 3.41).
• If γ0 is a closed path in a region Ω , it may be the case that we can continuously
shrink γ0 to a point z0 in Ω without leaving Ω (Figure 3.42). This situation is a
special case of the preceding one, when the γ1 (t) = z0 for all t, i.e., it is degenerated into a point.

tion of γ0 into a point z0 .

Definition 3.6.1. Let γ0 , γ1 be paths in a region Ω , both defined on [0, 1]. Assume
that γ0 (0) = γ1 (0) = α ∈ Ω and γ0 (1) = γ1 (1) = β ∈ Ω . We say that γ0 is homotopic
to γ1 (relative to Ω ) if there exists a continuous map H from the unit square Q =
[0, 1] × [0, 1] to Ω with the following properties:
H(t, 0) = γ0 (t),
H(t, 1) = γ1 (t),

0 ≤ t ≤ 1;
0 ≤ t ≤ 1;

(3.6.1)
(3.6.2)

H(0, s) = α ,
H(1, s) = β ,

0 ≤ s ≤ 1;
0 ≤ s ≤ 1.

(3.6.3)
(3.6.4)

The continuous mapping H is called a homotopy or a continuous deformation.

188

3 Complex Integration

To understand this definition, examine Figure 3.43. Condition (3.6.1) tells us that
the image of the lower side of Q is γ0 . Condition (3.6.2) says that the image of the
upper side of Q is γ1 . Conditions (3.6.3) and (3.6.4) dictate that the vertical sides of
Q are mapped to the endpoints of γ0 and γ1 .
The fact that Q is mapped into
Ω asserts that the image of any
horizontal section in Q is a curve
in Ω and because the vertical
sides of Q are mapped to the endpoints of γ0 and γ1 , this curve has
the same endpoints as γ0 and γ1 .
As s varies from 0 to 1, the curve
image of a horizontal section of
the square Q varies continuously
between the two extreme curves,
from γ0 to γ1 . For this reason a
homotopy is also called a continFig. 3.43 Continuous deformation
uous deformation.
The definition of a continuous deformation for closed paths is similar, but there
is an additional requirement that all intermediate paths be closed.
Definition 3.6.2. Let γ0 , γ1 be closed paths in a region Ω , both defined on [0, 1]. We
say that γ0 is homotopic to γ1 (relative to Ω ) if there exists a continuous map H
from Q = [0, 1] × [0, 1] to Ω with the following properties:
H(t, 0) = γ0 (t),
H(t, 1) = γ1 (t),
H(0, s) = H(1, s),

0 ≤ t ≤ 1;
0 ≤ t ≤ 1;
0 ≤ s ≤ 1.

(3.6.5)
(3.6.6)
(3.6.7)

Such a map H is called a homotopy or a continuous deformation (Figure 3.44). If
γ1 is a constant path, then we say that γ0 is homotopic to a point (Figure 3.45).
When γ0 is homotopic to a point condition (3.6.7) states that the initial point
H(0, s) and the terminal point H(1, s) are the same. In this case the images of all
horizontal sections of the square Q are closed curves (Figure 3.44).

Fig. 3.44 Deformation of closed paths.

Fig. 3.45 Deformation to a point.

3.6 Cauchy Integral Theorem For Simply Connected Regions

189

It is geometrically clear that if γ0 is homotopic to γ1 relative to Ω , then γ1 is
homotopic to γ0 relative to Ω . Also, if γ0 is homotopic to γ1 relative to Ω and
γ1 is homotopic to γ2 relative to Ω , then γ0 is homotopic to γ2 relative to Ω . See
Exercise 8. For this reason, we often say that γ0 and γ1 are homotopic to each other.
Example 3.6.3. (Continuous deformation of paths)
(a) Let Ω = C. The upper semicircle γ (t) = eit , 0 ≤ t ≤ π in Figure 3.46 is homotopic to the directed line segment joining 1 to −1.
(b) In the open unit disk B1 (0), the path [z1 , z2 , z3 ] is homotopic to the directed line
segment [z1 , z3 ]. See Figure 3.47.
(c) In the open unit disk B1 (0), the arc γ0 in Figure 3.48 is homotopic to the triangular path [z1 , z2 , z3 , z1 ].

(e) In the region Ω in Figure 3.50, the ellipse γ0 is homotopic to a point.
(f) In Figure 3.51, the region Ω consists of a disk minus the points z1 , z2 , z3 . Relative
to Ω , the circle γ0 is homotopic to the curve γ1 consisting of three circles centered
at z1 , z2 , z3 and connected by line segments traversed in both directions, as shown
in Figure 3.51.

As one may imagine, it is often difficult to construct the homotopy H, and so in
many situations we rely on intuition to decide whether a continuous deformation is

190

3 Complex Integration

possible. There are many interesting cases, however, where H can be constructed
explicitly.
Example 3.6.4. (Continuous deformation of paths) Show that the positively oriented circle C1 (0) is homotopic to the positively oriented circle C2 (0), relative to
the open disk of radius 3.
Solution. Intuitively, the result is obvious. To provide a rigorous proof, we construct a continuous mapping H of the
unit square taking C1 (0) continuously to
C2 (0), in the sense that (3.6.1), (3.6.2),
and (3.6.7) hold. Parametrize C1 (0) by
γ0 (t) = e2π it , 0 ≤ t ≤ 1, and C2 (0) by
γ1 (t) = 2e2π it , 0 ≤ t ≤ 1. For a fixed t in
[0, 1], consider the corresponding points
γ0 (t) on C1 (0) and γ1 (t) on C2 (0). We
can move continuously from γ0 (t) to γ1 (t)
along the line segment
(1 − s)γ0 (t) + sγ1 (t),

Fig. 3.52 Continuous deformation of C1 (0) to C2 (0).

0 ≤ s ≤ 1,

while staying in Ω (Figure 3.52).
Motivated by this idea, we let
H(t, s) = (1 − s)γ0 (t) + sγ1 (t),

0 ≤ t ≤ 1,

0 ≤ s ≤ 1.

(3.6.8)

Then H is a continuous mapping of (t, s)
in the unit square, because γ0 (t) and γ1 (t)
are continuous. Moreover, it is easy to
check that (3.6.1), (3.6.2), and (3.6.7)
hold. Indeed,
H(t, 0) = γ0 (t)
H(t, 1) = γ1 (t)

⇒
⇒

(3.6.1) holds,
(3.6.2) holds.

Also, since γ0 (0) = 1 = γ0 (1) and γ1 (0) =
2 = γ1 (1), we obtain
H(0, s) = (1 − s)γ0 (0) + sγ1 (0) = 1 + s,
H(1, s) = (1 − s)γ0 (1) + sγ1 (1) = 1 + s,
and so H(0, s) = H(1, s) implying (3.6.7).

Integral Invariance for Homotopic Paths
Theorem 3.6.5. Let f be an analytic function in a region Ω and let γ0 and γ1 be
paths in Ω .
(i) If γ0 (0) = γ1 (0) = α ∈ Ω , γ0 (1) = γ1 (1) = β ∈ Ω , and γ0 is homotopic to γ1
according to Definition 3.6.1, then
γ0

f (z) dz =

γ1

f (z) dz.

(3.6.9)

(ii) If γ0 and γ1 are closed homotopic paths then (3.6.9) holds.
(iii) If γ0 is homotopic to a point in Ω , then
γ0

f (z) dz = 0.

(3.6.10)

Proof. Note that the assertion in (iii) follows from that in (ii) because the integral
of a function over a point is zero. Also, the statement in (ii) is a consequence of
that in (i). Indeed, let α = γ0 (0) = γ0 (1) and β = γ1 (0) = γ1 (1). Define a path
γα ,β (s) = H(0, s) = H(1, s) in Ω that connects α to β . The consider the path γ1 =
γα ,β ∪ γ1 ∪ (γα ,β )∗ , which starts and ends at the point α just like γ0 . Then γ1 is
homotopic2 to γ0 . Assuming the assertion in (i), (3.6.9) gives

since (γα ,β )∗ f (z) dz = − γα ,β f (z) dz. Thus (ii) holds assuming (i).
We now prove the claimed assertion in (i). Let γ0 and γ1 be paths in Ω joining α
to β . If Ω is the entire plane, which is a star-shaped region, Theorem 3.5.4, yields
the claimed assertion. If Ω is not the entire plane, its boundary ∂ Ω is closed and
nonempty. Let H denote the mapping of the unit square Q = [0, 1]×[0, 1] into Ω that
continuously deforms γ0 into γ1 , and let K = H[Q]. Since Q is closed and bounded,
and H is continuous, it follows that K is closed and bounded. Since K is contained
in the (open region) Ω , it is disjoint from the closed boundary of Ω . So if δ denotes
the distance from ∂ Ω to K, then δ is positive (Appendix, page 483).
Since H is continuous on Q and Q is closed and bounded, it follows that H is
uniformly continuous on Q. So for the given δ > 0 (which plays the role of ε > 0 in
the definition of uniform continuity), there is a positive integer n such that
The mapping H (t, s) = H(0, 3ts) for 0 ≤ t ≤ 13 , H (t, s) = H(3t − 1, s) for
H(0, (3 − 3t)s) for 23 ≤ t ≤ 1, 0 ≤ s ≤ 1, continuously deforms γ0 to γ1 .

(3.6.11)

Having chosen n, construct a grid over Q by subdividing the sides into n equal
subintervals (Figure 3.54). This is a network of simplices, where each smaller
square in this network
is called a simplicial square. Label the points on the grid

by p jk = nj , nk , j, k = 0, 1, . . . , n, and let z jk = H(p jk ).

Fig. 3.54 A simplicial network on the square Q with a sample simplicial square
with one corner at p32 . The simplicial squares are so small that the image of each
is contained in a disk in Ω of radius δ > 0, where δ is the distance between the
boundary of Ω , ∂ Ω , and the closed and bounded set H[Q].

Condition (3.6.11) guarantees that the image of each simplicial square lies in the
open disk Bδ (z jk ), and hence, the closed polygonal path

σ jk = [z jk , z( j+1) k , z( j+1) (k+1) , z j (k+1) , z jk ]

(3.6.12)

is also contained in Bδ (z jk ) (see Figure 3.55). Since f is analytic on Bδ (z jk ), which
is obviously star-shaped, Theorem 3.5.4 yields
σ jk

f (z) dz = 0.

Adding the integrals over all the σ jk ’s, we note that the integrals over the segments that correspond to internal sides of the simplicial squares cancel, since each
internal segment is traversed twice in opposite directions. Thus the only integrals
that do not cancel are those over line segments that correspond to external sides of
the simplicial squares, that is, the boundary of Q.
Figure 3.55 shows a typical closed polygonal path obtained by joining the images
of the four corners of one simplicial square. By construction, these polygonal paths
are contained in disks of radius δ in Ω . Figure 3.56 displays the outcome of the
cancelation; after summing all the path integrals and canceling those that are traversed in opposite direction, the only ones that remain are those that correspond to
the boundary of Q.

path.

The integrals on the line segments connecting z jk going up the right side and
down the left side of Q are each zero because the z jk are fixed at α and β . The only
remaining integrals are on the line segments corresponding to the bottom and top
sides of Q. So we obtain

where γ0, j is the portion of the path γ0 that joins the points z j0 and z( j+1)0 (Figure 3.56).

f (z) dz =

f (z) dz.

Simply Connected Regions
It is important to be precise about the region Ω when talking about deformation
of paths. For instance, consider the situations depicted in Figures 3.57 and 3.58. In
Figure 3.57 the upper and lower semicircles joining the points −1 to 1 are homotopic
in the disk of radius 2. However, in Figure 3.58, the upper and lower semicircles
joining the points −1 to 1 are not homotopic in the punctured disk of radius 2. You
can imagine a stick protruding at the origin, which will prevent us from continuously
deforming the upper part of the unit circle onto the lower one.

Fig. 3.57 Continuous deformation is possible.

Fig. 3.58 Continuous deformation is not possible.

The situation encountered in the preceding examples leads to the following
important definition.
Definition 3.6.6. A region Ω is called simply connected if all paths joining α to
β in Ω are homotopic relative to Ω . If a region is not simply connected, then it is
called multiply connected.
Geometrically, a region is simply connected if and only if it has no holes in it.
The regions in Figures 3.59 are simply connected but the ones in 3.60 are not simply
connected.

Fig. 3.59 Three simply-connected regions.

3.6 Cauchy Integral Theorem For Simply Connected Regions

195

Fig. 3.60 Three multiply connected regions. In the figure on the left a path is shown that is
not homotopic to a point. In the remaining two pictures two non-homotopic paths relative
to the region are shown.

Suppose that Ω is a simply connected region, f is analytic on Ω , α and β are
two points in Ω , and γ0 and γ1 are arbitrary paths in Ω joining α to β . Since γ0 and
γ1 are homotopic relative to Ω , Theorem 3.6.5 implies that the integral of f over γ0
is equal to its integral over γ1 . In other words, the integral of f is independent of
path in Ω .
Theorem 3.6.7. (Cauchy’s Theorem for Simply Connected Regions) Let f be an
analytic function on a simply connected region Ω . If γ is a closed path in Ω , then
γ

f (z) dz = 0.

(3.6.15)

Proof. Equality (3.6.15) is an immediate consequence of Theorem 3.6.5 (ii), since

every closed path in Ω is homotopic to a point.
Remark 3.6.8. An informal restatement of Theorem 3.6.7 is that if f is analytic on
a simple closed path3 and its interior, then the integral of f around this path is zero.
Corollary 3.6.9. Let f be an analytic function on a simply connected region Ω .
Then the following are valid:
(i) If γ0 and γ1 are two paths in Ω with the same initial and terminal point, then
γ0

f (z) dz =

γ1

f (z) dz.

(ii) There is an analytic function F defined on Ω such that F  = f .
Proof. The claimed assertions (i) and (ii) follow by combining Theorem 3.6.7 with
Theorem 3.3.4.

Remark 3.6.10. We note that the antiderivative F of f in part (ii) of Corollary 3.6.9
is
f (ζ ) d ζ ,
F(z) =
γ (z0 ,z)

where z0 is a fixed point in Ω and the integral is taken over a path γ (z0 , z) in Ω
joining z0 to z.

3.7 Cauchy’s Theorem for Multiply Connected Regions
For subsequent applications, we prove a version of Cauchy’s theorem that involves
several simple paths arranged as follows: C is a simple closed path and C1 ,C2 . . . ,Cn
are disjoint simple closed paths, contained in the interior of C and such that the
interior regions of any two C j ’s have no common points. To simplify our study, we
require that C and all Cj s have the same positive orientation.
An interesting situation arises when the C j ’s
contain in their interior parts of the complement of a region Ω and C contains all C j . For
instance Ω could be the shaded region in Figure 3.61. Our goal in this section is to prove
Cauchy’s theorem for such paths. To do so, we
need a theorem from topology which, like the
Jordan curve theorem, although it is very intuitive, it is quite difficult to prove. For a proof
of the next theorem we refer to Selected Topics
in the Classical Theory of Functions of a Complex Variable by Maurice Heins, Dover (2015),
republication of the edition by Holt, Rinehart
& Winston, New York, 1962.

Fig. 3.61 The domain Ω contains
the region interior to C and exterior
to all C j ’s.

Theorem 3.7.1. (Jordan Arc Theorem) Suppose that U is a region that contains a
simple non-closed path γ . Then U \ γ is also a region, i.e., it is open and connected.
The main result of this section is the following extension of Theorem 3.6.7 to the
setting of multiply connected domains.
Theorem 3.7.2. (Cauchy’s Theorem for Multiply Connected Regions) Let n ∈
N and Ω1 , . . . , Ωn be pairwise disjoint simply connected regions
 is
 whose union
contained in another simply connected region Ω0 . Let Ω = Ω0 \ Ω1 ∪· · ·∪ Ωn . For
j = 1, . . . , n, let C j be disjoint simple closed paths with positive orientation whose
interior regions contain Ω j and assume that C j are pairwise disjoint. Let C be a
simple closed path with positive orientation in Ω whose interior region contains all
C j . Suppose that f is an analytic function on Ω . Then we have

(3.7.1)

Remark 3.7.3. We may informally say that in the hypothesis of the preceding theorem the function f is required to be analytic on a path4 C and on its interior minus
a few simply connected ‘holes’ denoted by Ω j .
Proof. Fix a point z0 on the outer path C. Join z0 to a point w1 in C1 via a simple
polygonal path L1 . Pick z1 on C and let P1 be the part
 of C1 from w1 to z1 traversed
in the orientation of C1 . By Theorem 3.7.1, Ω \ L1 ∪ P1 is connected, and thus,
there is a simple polygonal path L2 disjoint from L1 ∪ P1 that joins z1 to a point w2
in C2 .
Pick z2 ∈ C2 and let P2 be thepart of C2 from w2 to z2 traversed in the orientation
of C2 . By Theorem 3.7.1, Ω \ L1 ∪ P1 ∪ L2 ∪ P2 is connected, and thus, there is
simple polygonal path L3 disjoint from L1 ∪ P1 ∪ L2 ∪ P2 that joins z2 to a point
w3 in C3 .
Continuing in this fashion, we find points wn and zn on Cn and we let Pn be
the part of Cn from wn to zn traversed in the same orientation. At the end, join zn
to a point wn+1 in C via a simple polygonal path Ln+1 that does not intersect the
previously selected path from z0 to zn , passing through w1 , z1 , w2 , z2 , . . ., wn . In the
selection of these points we defined
Pj = part of C j from w j to z j traversed in the orientation of C j
for j = 1, . . . , n, and now also define
Q j = part of C j from z j to w j traversed in the orientation of C j .
Also let P be the part of C from z0 to wn+1 and let Q be the part of C from wn+1 to
z0 both traversed in the orientation inherited by C.
This construction yields two simple
closed paths Γ1 and Γ2 , as illustrated in
Figure 3.62, precisely defined as follows:

for j = 1, . . . , n. (Recall that γ ∗ is the
reverse of a path γ .)
Fig. 3.62 The construction of Γ1 and Γ2 .

Moreover, we have arranged so that all pieces of the complement of Ω in the
interior of C do not lie in the interior of Γ1 or Γ2 . Thus the interior regions of Γ1
and Γ2 are simply connected and f is analytic in a slightly larger simply connected

which is equivalent to (3.7.1).

Next, in the fundamental integral of Example 3.2.10, we replace the circle by
an arbitrary positively oriented, simple, closed path C that does not contain a fixed
point z0 .

not on C. Then

In what follows, we illustrate the applications of the formula in Example 3.7.4.

Solution. The first thing to check is
whether f (z) = z21+1 is analytic inside and
on C. If it is, then we can apply Cauchy’s

analytic at the points z = ±i, where the
denominator z2 + 1 vanishes. Since one
of these values is inside C, we apply
Cauchy’s theorem for multiple paths, as
in the previous example or, better yet, use
the result of the previous example. The
method uses partial fractions and goes as
follows. Since z2 + 1 = (z − i)(z + i), we
have the partial fraction decomposition

where C is the figure-eight path shown in Figure 3.64.
The path C in Figure 3.64 is not simple because it intersects itself. To use
Cauchy’s integral theorem for simple paths, we break up C into two simple paths,
as shown in Figure 3.65.

Fig. 3.64 The path C is not
simple.

Fig. 3.65 Breaking up C as a union of two simple paths.

Solution. Start by breaking up the path into two simple closed paths, C1 and C2 , as
shown in Figure 3.65. Note that the orientation of C1 is negative, while the orientation of C2 is positive. The integral (3.7.6) becomes

C1

3.8 Cauchy Integral Formula
In this section we establish the Cauchy integral formula and derive some applications related to the evaluation of integrals and properties of analytic functions.
We have managed to compute integrals of the form
1
dζ
C ζ −z
where C is a simple closed curve and z is a point in the interior of the curve. In this
section we discuss how to compute integrals of the form

or similar integrals for other analytic functions in place of eζ .

Theorem 3.8.1. (Cauchy Integral Formula) Suppose that f is an analytic function
defined on a region U that contains a simple closed path C with positive orientation
and its interior. If z is a point in the interior of C, then
f (z) =

1
2π i

f (ζ )
dζ .
C ζ −z

(3.8.1)

Proof. Given a point z in the interior of C, pick R > 0 such that the closed disk
BR (z) = {w : |w − z| ≤ R} is contained
inside C. The function

ζ→

f (ζ )
ζ −z

is analytic in the region inside C and
outside the circle Cr (z), where 0 < r ≤
R (see Figure 3.70). Applying Theorem 3.7.2 (Cauchy’s theorem for multiply connected regions) with the variable
of integration being ζ , we obtain

d ζ = lim

To finish the proof, we show that the limit on the right is f (z). We need the MLinequality (Theorem 3.2.19) and the following observations:
• Since z lies inside Cr (z) and we are integrating with respect to ζ , by Example 3.7.4 we have
2π i =

Cr (z)

d ζ ⇒ f (z) =

• The perimeter of Cr (z) is (Cr (z)) = 2π r, and since z is the center of Cr (z), for
all ζ on Cr (z), we have |ζ − z| = r.
• Since f is continuous at z, Mr (z) = maxζ ∈Cr (z) | f (z) − f (ζ )| tends to 0 as r → 0.
We can now complete the proof:

ζ)
If z is a point outside C, then the function ζ → ζf (−z
is analytic inside and on C,
and so its integral along C is zero, by Cauchy’s theorem. Let us combine this observation with (3.8.1) in one convenient formula in which the variable of integration is
denoted z:

f (z)

f (z0 ) if z0 is inside C,
dz =

(b) In evaluating C2 (1) (z+3)(z−2)

at the points z = −3 and z = 2. Only the point z = 2 is inside the curve C2 (1). So if

Some integrals require multiple applications of Cauchy’s formula along with
applications of Cauchy’s theorem. We illustrate this situation with an example.

eπ z
C2 (0)

z2 + 1

dz .

Solution. Since
1
z2 + 1

=

1
,
(z + i)(z − i)

the integral cannot be computed directly
from Cauchy’s formula, since the path
contains both ±i in its interior. To overcome this difficulty, draw small nonintersecting circles inside C2 (0) around ±i,
say C1/4 (i) and C1/4 (−i), as illustrated
πz
in Figure 3.71. Since z2e+1 is analytic in
a region containing the interior of C2 (0)
and the exterior of the smaller circles, by
Cauchy’s theorem for multiple connected
domains (Theorem 3.7.2), we have
eπ z
C2 (0)

Now, the two integrals on the right can be evaluated with the help of Cauchy’s
integral formula (3.8.2). For the first one, we apply Cauchy’s formula (3.8.2) with
eπ z
and z0 = i, and obtain
f (z) = z+i
eπ z
dz =
C1/4 (i) (z − i)(z + i)
Since f (i) =

dz = 2π i f (i).

Adding the two integrals together, we find that

C2 (0) (z − i)(z + i)
Cauchy’s integral formula (3.8.1) shows that the values of f (z), for z inside the
path C, are determined by the values of f on the curve C, and the way to recapture
the values inside C is to integrate f (ζ ) against the function 1/[2π i(ζ − z)] on C.
Something analogous is valid for the derivatives of f . To achieve this we need to
know how to differentiate under the integral sign.

Differentiation Under the Integral Sign
We focus on the analyticity (and also continuity) of a function of the form
g(z) =

Theorem 3.8.5. Let C be a path and let U be an open set. Let φ (z, ζ ) be a function
defined for z ∈ U and ζ ∈ C. Suppose that φ (z, ζ ) is continuous in ζ ∈ C and analytic in z ∈ U and that the complex derivative ddzφ (z, ζ ) is continuous in ζ ∈ C. Then

Proof. For a fxied z0 ∈ U choose R > 0 so that BR (z0 ) is contained in U. Let
M=

max

z∈BR (z0 ),ζ ∈C

|φ (z, ζ )|.

Since continuous functions attain a maximum on compact (i.e., closed and bounded)
sets, we have M < ∞. For each ζ , by assumption φ (z, ζ ) is an analytic function of z
in U. For z such that 0 < |z − z0 | < R2 and ζ ∈ C, Lemma 3.8.4 implies

where we have used the ML-inequality and (3.8.9). As z → z0 , the difference quotient on the left side of the inequality approaches g (z0 ), while the right side of the



Generalized Cauchy Integral Formula
We now use Theorem 3.8.5 to deduce the generalized Cauchy integral formula.
Theorem 3.8.6. (Generalized Cauchy Integral Formula) Suppose that f is analytic on a region Ω that contains a positively oriented simple closed path C and its
interior. Then f has derivatives of any order at all points z in the interior of C given
by
f (ζ )
n!
f (n) (z) =
dζ .
(3.8.10)
2π i C (ζ − z)n+1
Proof. When n = 0, f (0) = f and 0! = 1; in this case identity was proved in Theorem 3.8.1. Let U be the interior of C. Assuming by induction that (3.8.10) holds for
a natural number n, for z ∈ U and ζ ∈ C define

φ (z, ζ ) =

f (ζ )
n!
,
2π i (ζ − z)n+1

and note that φ (z, ζ ) is analytic in z in U and continuous in ζ ∈ C. Moreover, for
z ∈ U we have
dφ
f (ζ )
(n + 1)!
(z, ζ ) =

dz
2π i (ζ − z)n+2

Solution. Since the path Γ intersects itself, it is not simple. As we cannot directly
appeal to Cauchy’s formulas, we decompose Γ into two simple paths Γ1 and Γ2 , as
shown in Figure 3.74. Noting that (z − i)(z2 + 1) = (z − i)2 (z + i), we have

The integrals on the right can now be evaluated with the help of Cauchy’s generalized integral formula (3.8.10). We must be careful with the orientation of the paths:

We end the section with some important theoretical applications of Cauchy’s formula. The first result is already contained in Theorem 3.8.6 but deserves a separate
statement because of its importance.
Corollary 3.8.9. Suppose that f is analytic in an open set Ω . Then f has derivatives
of all orders f  , f  , f (3) , f (4) , . . . which are analytic functions in Ω .
Proof. For z in Ω , let BR (z) be a closed disk contained in Ω . Pick C to be the
boundary of this closed disk. By Theorem 3.8.6, all derivatives of f exist in Ω \C,
and in particular at the given point z. These derivatives are shown in (3.8.10).

Consider the function h(t) = t 3 , −∞ < t < ∞. Its derivative, f  (t) = 53 t 3 , exists
and is continuous for all real t; however, f  (t) does not exist at t = 0. Thus Corollary 3.8.9 has no analog in the theory of functions of a real variable.
The following is a converse to Cauchy’s theorem. It is named after the Italian
mathematician Giacinto Morera (1856–1907).
Theorem 3.8.10. (Morera’s Theorem) Let f be a continuous complex-valued function on a region Ω . Suppose that for all closed disks B contained in Ω and for all
closed paths γ in B we have
γ

f (z) dz = 0 .

(3.8.11)

Then the function f is analytic on Ω .
Proof. For every z ∈ Ω there is a disk Br (z) contained in Ω . Since (3.8.11) holds for
all closed paths γ contained in Br (z), applying Theorem 3.3.4, we obtain that there
is an analytic function F on Br (z) such that F  = f . By Corollary 3.8.9, f is analytic

in Br (z). Since z is arbitrary in Ω , it follows that f is analytic in Ω .

3.9 Bounds for Moduli of Analytic Functions
In this section, we present several fundamental results about analytic functions,
including the famous Liouville theorem, and the maximum modulus principle. We
also give a simple proof of the fundamental theorem of algebra.
Theorem 3.9.1. (Cauchy Estimates) Suppose that f is analytic on an open disk
BR (z0 ) with center at z0 and radius R > 0. Suppose that | f (z)| ≤ M for all z in
BR (z0 ). Then

Proof. Since we are not assuming that f is analytic on a domain that contains the

circle CR (z0 ), we fix 0 < r < R and work on
a disk of radius r on which f is analytic (see
Figure 3.79). Applying Theorem 3.8.6, for any
n ∈ N, we write
f (n) (z0 ) =

Applying the ML-inequality [i.e., estimate (3.2.31)] to the integral on the right side

Since this holds for all 0 < r < R, letting r → R we deduce (3.9.1).



The following surprising application of Cauchy’s estimate was proved by the
French Mathematician Joseph Liouville (1809–1882). Recall that a function is
called entire if it is analytic on all of C.
Theorem 3.9.2. (Liouville’s Theorem) A bounded entire function must be constant.
Proof. Let f be an entire function satisfying | f (z)| ≤ M for all z ∈ C. Applying
Cauchy’s estimate to f  on a disk of radius R > 0 around a point z0 ∈ C, we obtain

| f  (z0 )| ≤ M
R . Letting R → ∞, we obtain that f (z0 ) = 0. Since z0 is arbitrary, it
follows that f  (z) = 0 for all z, and hence, f is constant as a consequence of Theorem 2.5.7.

Here is one useful application of Liouville’s theorem.
Corollary 3.9.3. If f is entire and | f (z)| → ∞ as |z| → ∞, then f must have at least
one zero.
Proof. Suppose to the contrary that f has no zeros in C. Then g = 1/ f is also entire
and |g(z)| → 0 as |z| → ∞. This property implies that g is bounded on C (Exercise
14). By Theorem 3.9.2, g is constant and consequently f is constant.

The exponential function ez is entire and never equals to 0. As a consequence of
Corollary 3.9.3, we deduce that |ez | does not tend to infinity as |z| → ∞, although
e|z| tends to infinity as |z| → ∞.

3 Complex Integration

We now turn our attention to the fundamental theorem of algebra, first proved by
Gauss in 1799 (with a topological gap) and then again by him in 1816 in two other
ways different from the first one.
Theorem 3.9.4. (Fundamental Theorem of Algebra) Every polynomial of degree
n ≥ 1 has exactly n zeros counted according to multiplicity.
Proof. It is enough to show that every polynomial p of degree n ≥ 1 has at least one
zero. For, if we know that z0 is a zero of p, then we write p(z) = (z − z0 )q(z), where
q is a polynomial of degree n − 1 (Exercise 13). We continue factoring until we have
written p as the product of n linear terms times a constant, which shows that p has
exactly n roots. So let us show that p has at least one zero. If an = 0, write


a1
an−1
a0
p(z) = an zn + an−1 zn−1 + · · · + a1 z + a0 = zn an +
+ · · · + n−1 + n .
z
z
z
As z → ∞, the quantity inside the parentheses approaches an , while |zn | → ∞, and
hence |p(z)| → ∞. We complete the proof by applying Corollary 3.9.3.


Maximum and Minimum Principles
Suppose that f is analytic in a region Ω and let BR (z) be a closed disk contained in
Ω . Parametrize the circle CR (z) by ζ (t) = z + Reit , 0 ≤ t ≤ 2π , d ζ = Rieit dt. The
Cauchy integral formula implies that

(3.9.4)

The integral on the right is a Riemann integral of a complex-valued function of
t. Recalling that the integral is an average, this formula shows that the value of an
analytic function at a point z in Ω is equal to the average value of f over a circle
centered at z and contained in Ω . This important property is expressed by saying
that an analytic function f has the mean value property. If we take absolute values
on both sides of (3.9.4), we obtain

The following lemma about real functions states an obvious fact: If the values
of a function are less than or equal to some constant M and if the average of the
function is equal to M, then the function must be identically equal to M.
Lemma 3.9.5. (i) Suppose that h is a continuous real-valued function such that
h(t) ≥ 0 for all t in [a, b] (a < b). If
b
a

h(t) dt = 0,

then h(t) = 0 for all t in [a, b].
(ii) Suppose that h is a continuous real-valued function such that h(t) ≤ M (alternatively, h(t) ≥ M) for all t in [a, b]. If
b

1
b−a

a

h(t) dt = M,

then h(t) = M for all t in [a, b].
Proof. (i) The proof is by contradiction. Assume that h(t0 ) = δ > 0 for some t0
in (a, b). Since h is continuous, we can find an interval (c, d) that contains t0 with
(c, d) ⊂ (a, b) and h(t) > δ /2 for all t in (c, d). Since the integral of a nonnegative
function increases if we increase the interval of integration, we conclude that
b
a

h(t) dt ≥

d
c

h(t) dt ≥

δ
(d − c) > 0,
2

which is a contradiction. Hence h(t) = 0 for all t in (a, b) and, by continuity of h, h
is also 0 at the endpoints a and b.
(ii) We consider the case h ≤ M only as the other case is similar. Let k = M − h.
Then k is a continuous and nonnegative function. Note that
b
a

k(t) dt = 0 ⇔

1
b−a

b
a

(M − h(t)) dt = 0 ⇔

1
b−a

h(t) dt = M.

As the last equation holds, k must have vanishing integral, and from part (i) it follows that k is identically equal to zero; thus, h is identically equal to M.

Theorem 3.9.6. (Maximum Modulus Principle) Suppose that f is analytic on a
region Ω . If | f | attains a maximum in Ω , then f is constant in Ω .
Proof. The connectedness property of Ω is crucial in the proof. Suppose that | f |
attains a maximum in Ω . If we show that | f | is constant, then by Exercise 36,
Section 2.5, it will follow that f is constant. Let M = maxz∈Ω | f (z)|,

Ω0 = {z ∈ Ω : | f (z)| < M}
Ω1 = {z ∈ Ω : | f (z)| = M}.

222

3 Complex Integration

Clearly, Ω = Ω0 ∪ Ω1 , and Ω0 and Ω1 are disjoint, and Ω1 is nonempty because | f |
is assumed to attain its maximum in Ω . The set Ω0 is open because | f | is continuous
(Exercise 41, Section 2.2). If we show that Ω1 is also open, then, as Ω is open
and connected, it cannot be written as the union of two disjoint open nonempty
sets (Proposition 2.1.7). This will force Ω0 to be empty. Consequently, Ω = Ω1 ,
implying that | f | = M is constant in Ω .
So let us prove that Ω1 is open. Pick z
in Ω1 . Since Ω is open, we can find an
open disk Bδ (z) in Ω , centered at z with
radius δ > 0. We will show that Bδ (z)
is contained in Ω1 . This will imply that
Ω1 is open. Let 0 < r < δ as shown in
Figure 3.80. Using (3.9.5) and the fact
that | f (z)| = M, we obtain

and Lemma 3.9.5(ii) implies that
f (z + reit ) = M
for all t in [0, 2π ]. This shows that Cr (z), the circle of radius r and center at z, is
contained in Ω1 . But this is true for all r satisfying 0 < r < δ , and this implies that

Bδ (z) is contained in Ω1 .
Suppose that f is analytic in Ω and continuous on the boundary of Ω . By Theorem 3.9.6, | f | cannot attain its maximum inside Ω unless f is constant. This leads
us to the following two questions.
• Does | f | attain its maximum on the boundary of Ω ?
• If | f (z)| ≤ M on the boundary of Ω , can we infer that | f (z)| ≤ M for all z in Ω ?
The next example shows that in general the answers to both questions are negative.

Example 3.9.7. (Failure of the maximum principle on unbounded regions)
Let Ω = {z : Re z > 0, Im z > 0} be the first quadrant, bounded by the semiinfinite nonnegative x- and y-axes.

3.9 Bounds for Moduli of Analytic Functions

223

Let f (z) = e−iz which can also be
2
2
written as f (x + iy) = e−i(x −y +2ixy) =
2
2
e−i(x −y ) e2xy if z = x + iy. We have
2

| f (z)| = ei(x

2 −y2 )

e2xy = e2xy .

On the boundary, we have x = 0 or y = 0
and so | f (z)| = 1; however, it is clear
that | f (z)| = e2xy is not bounded in Ω .
To see this, take x = y and let x, y → ∞;
2
then | f (x + i y)| = e2x → ∞ as shown in
Figure 3.81.


Fig. 3.81 The maximum of
| f | in Example 3.9.7 does not
occur on the boundary of the
first quadrant.

Example 3.9.7 shows that the modulus of an analytic function need not attain its
maximum on the boundary, and the maximum value of the modulus on the boundary
may not be the maximum value inside the region. As we now show, the situation is
different if Ω is bounded. In this case, the answers to both questions above are
affirmative.
Corollary 3.9.8. (Maximum Modulus Principle) Suppose that Ω is a bounded
region and f is analytic on Ω and continuous on its closure Ω . Then
(i) | f | attains its maximum M on the boundary of Ω , and
(ii) either f is constant or | f (z)| < M for all z in Ω .
Proof. If f is constant then (i) and (ii) hold obviously. Suppose f is not constant.
The set consisting of Ω and its boundary is closed and bounded. Since | f | is continuous on this set, it attains its maximum M on this set. But Theorem 3.9.6 says | f |
cannot attain its maximum in Ω , so | f | attains its maximum on the boundary of Ω
and | f | < M in Ω .

The modulus of a nonconstant analytic function can attain its minimum on a
region Ω . Consider, for example, the function z on the open disk |z| < 1. Then
the minimum of |z| is 0 and it is attained at z = 0. However, if the function never
vanishes in Ω , then we have the following useful principle.
Theorem 3.9.9. Suppose that f is nonvanishing and analytic on a region Ω . If | f |
attains a minimum in Ω , then f is constant in Ω .
Proof. Apply the maximum modulus principle to g = 1/ f .



Combining the previous two results, we obtain the following principle.
Corollary 3.9.10. Suppose that Ω is a bounded region and f is analytic and nonvanishing on Ω and continuous on Ω . Then
(i) | f | attains a maximum M and minimum m on the boundary of Ω , and
(ii) either f is constant or m < | f (z)| < M for all z in Ω .

Example 3.9.11. (Maximum and minimum values) Let f (z) = ez , where z takes
values in the annulus 12 ≤ |z| ≤ 1. Find the points where the maximum and minimum
values of | f (z)| occur and determine these values.
Solution. By Corollary 3.9.10, we must look for the maximum and minimum values
on the boundary of the annular region, which consists of two circles |z| = 12 and
|z| = 1 (Figure 3.82). On the inner boundary, |z| = 12 , we have
| f (z)| =

ex
|ez |
=
= 2ex ,
|z|
1/2

where we have used the fact that |ez | = ex . For z on the inner circle, x varies from
−1/2 to 1/2. The minimum value of 2ex occurs at x = −1/2 (or z = −1/2) and its
maximum value occurs when x = 1/2 (or z = 1/2).

Fig. 3.82 The domain of f (z) =
ez /z is the annulus 1/2 < |z| < 1.

Fig. 3.83 The minimum value of
| f (z)| is attained at z = −1 and
the maximum value at z = 12 .

Thus the minimum, respectively, maximum, values of | f (z)| on the inner boundary are
| f (−1/2)| =

2
e−1/2
= √ ≈ 1.2
1/2
e

and

| f (1/2)| =

1/2

Similarly, on the outer boundary |z| = 1, we have
| f (z)| =

|ez | ex
=
= ex .
|z|
1

For z on the outer circle, since x varies from −1 to 1, ex varies from e−1 to e.
Thus the minimum, respectively, maximum values of | f (z)| on the outer boundary
≈ 2.7. Comparing the extreme
are | f (−1)| = e−1 = 1/e ≈ 0.4 and | f (1)| = e √

In Example 3.9.11, the maximum value of the modulus was attained at precisely
one point on the boundary, and similarly for the minimum value. This is not always
be the case. Consider the function g(z) = 1/z for 1 ≤ |z| ≤ 2. The maximum value
of |g(z)| is attained at all points on the inner circle |z| = 1, and the minimum value
is attained at all points of the outer circle |z| = 2.

Series of Analytic Functions and Singularities
If, for every increasing value of n, the sum Sn indefinitely
approaches a certain limit S, the series will be called convergent, and the limit in question will be called the sum of
the series. If, on the contrary, while n increases indefinitely,
the sum Sn does not approach a fixed limit, the series will be
divergent and will no longer have a sum.
-Augustin-Louis Cauchy (1789–1857)
(Cauchy’s definition of a convergent series from his Cours d’
analyse.
In calculus, we use Taylor series to represent functions on intervals centered at
fixed points with a radius of convergence that could be positive, infinite, or zero,
depending on the remainder associated with the function. For example, cos x, ex ,
2
1
, and the function defined by e−1/x for x = 0 and 0 if x = 0 are all infinitely
1+x2
differentiable for all real x. The radius of convergence of the Taylor series representation around zero is ∞ for the first two, 1 for the third one, and 0 for the last one.
However in complex analysis, Taylor series are much nicer, in the sense that the
remainder will play no role in determining their convergence. If a function is analytic on a disk of radius R centered at z0 , then it has a Taylor series representation
1
centered at z0 with radius at least R. For example the function 1+z
2 is analytic on
the disk |z| < 1 but, as it is not differentiable at z = ±i, we do not expect the series
to have a radius of convergence larger than 1.
Taylor series, and more generally Laurent series, are used to study important
properties of analytic functions, concerning their zeros and isolated problem points
(singularities). They are also useful in studying properties of special functions, such
as Bessel functions.
The theory of power series as described in this chapter owes a lot to the German
mathematician Karl Weierstrass (1815–1897). Weierstrass introduced to analysis
the (ε , δ )-notation in proofs, replacing Cauchy’s terminology, such as “indefinitely
approaches a certain limit” and “increases indefinitely.” Weierstrass’ contributions
to analysis are evidenced by the number of fundamental results we encounter here
that bear his name.

4.1 Sequences and Series of Functions
In Section 1.5 we considered sequences and series of complex numbers. Now we
turn our attention to sequences and series of functions.
Suppose that fn and f are complex-valued functions defined on a subset E ⊂ C.
We say that fn converges pointwise to f on E, if limn→∞ fn (z)= f (z) for every z in E.

4 Series of Analytic Functions and Singularities

Hence fn converges pointwise to f on E if for every z in E and every ε > 0 we can
find N > 0 (depending on z and ε ) such that for all n ≥ N, we have | f (z)− fn (z)| < ε .
It is important to notice that the integer N depends in general on both z and ε .
Suppose un is defined on a set E ⊂ C. The series of functions ∑∞
n=1 un is said to
converge pointwise if the sequence of partial sums sn = ∑nk=1 uk converges pointwise on E.
In general, pointwise convergence does not preserve some desirable properties
of the functions fn . For example, the pointwise limit of continuous functions may
not be continuous; and the pointwise limit of analytic functions may not be analytic. These properties are preserved, however, by the following stronger mode of
convergence.
Definition 4.1.1. Let { fn }∞
n=1 be a sequence of functions. We say that f n converges
uniformly to f on E, and we write limn→∞ fn = f uniformly on E, if for every ε > 0
we can find N > 0 such that for all n ≥ N and all z in E, we have | fn (z) − f (z)| < ε .
A series of functions ∑∞
n=1 un is said to converge uniformly on E if the sequence
of partial sums sn = ∑nk=1 uk converges uniformly on E.
The key words in Definition 4.1.1 are “for all z in E.” These require that fn (z)
be close to f (z) for all z in E simultaneously. Let Mn = max | fn (z) − f (z)|, where
the maximum is taken over all z in E. If no maximum is attained, we set1 Mn =
sup{| fn (z) − f (z)| : z ∈ E}. An equivalent formulation of uniform convergence is
fn → f uniformly on E

⇐⇒

Mn → 0 as n → ∞.

(4.1.1)

As a first example, we take E to be a real interval.
Example 4.1.2. (Pointwise versus uniform convergence) For 0 ≤ x ≤ 1 and n =
1, 2, . . . define
2nx
fn (x) =
.
1 + n2 x2
(a) Does the sequence converge pointwise on [0, 1]?
(b) Does it converge uniformly on [0, 1]?
(c) Does it converge uniformly on [0.1, 1]?
Solution. (a) We have fn (0) = 0 for all n, and so fn (x) → 0 if x = 0. For all x = 0,
we have
2nx
1 2x

= 0.
lim fn (x) = lim

n→∞
n→∞ 1 + n x
n→∞ n x2 + 1

n

{ fn (x)}∞
n=1

So for all x in [0, 1], the sequence
converges pointwise to f (x) = 0.
(b) Figure 4.1 suggests that the sequence does not converge to 0 uniformly on [0, 1].
To confirm this, let us see how large | fn (x)| can get on the interval [0, 1]. For this
purpose, we compute the derivative
1 The supremum of a bounded set is the least upper bound of the set. Its existence follows from the
completeness of the real number system.

fn (x) =

(1 + n2 x2 )2

Thus, for 0 < x ≤ 1,
1
x= .
n
 
Plugging this value into fn (x) and simplifying, we find fn 1n = 1. Thus, no
matter how large n is, we can always find x in [0, 1], namely x = 1n , with fn (x) = 1.
This shows that Mn = maxx∈[0, 1] | fn (x)| ≥ 1 (in fact, Mn = 1), and so fn does not
converge to 0 uniformly over [0, 1]. To see what is going on, note that fn (x) =
f1 (nx). That is, fn (x) is merely a horizontally shrunken version of the curve f1 (x)
and has maximum value of 1. This maximum value moves left as n increases, but it
never leaves the interval [0, 1].

for n = 10, 50, 100. Note
how fn (x) attains its maximum value in [0.1, 1] at
x = 0.1.

(c) The situation here is quite different than that in part (b). For n > 10, we have
1
n < 0.1, and so the maximum value of f n (x), which we found to be 1 in (b), is not
attained in the interval [0.1, 1]; it is attained at 1n outside this interval. So how large
is fn (x) for x in [0.1, 1]? Since fn (x) ≤ 0 on [ 1n , 1], fn (x) is decreasing on [ 1n , 1] and
so the maximum of fn (x) for x in the interval [0.1, 1] occurs at the left endpoint,

(Figure 4.2). We have Mn = fn ( 10
), and we know that fn ( 10
) → 0 as n → ∞
x = 10

from part (a). Thus Mn → 0, implying that fn → 0 uniformly on [0.1, 1].
There is an important point to be made about part (c) of Example 4.1.2. Clearly
we could have replaced the left endpoint x = 0.1 by any number a with 0 < a < 1
and still had uniform convergence on [a, 1]. While the sequence failed to converge
uniformly on [0, 1], it does converge uniformly on any proper closed subinterval
[a, 1] where 0 < a < 1. This is a common phenomenon that one encounters with
many sequences or series. They may fail to converge uniformly on a whole region,
but they may converge uniformly on all closed (and bounded) proper subregions.

We now examine the preservation of continuity and integrability in the context
of uniform limits of functions.
Theorem 4.1.3. (i) Suppose that fn → f uniformly on E and fn is continuous on E
for every n. Then f is continuous on E.
(ii) Suppose u = ∑∞
n=1 un converges uniformly on E and un is continuous on E for
every n. Then u is continuous on E.
Proof. (i) Fix z0 in E. Given ε > 0, by uniform convergence we can find fN such
that | fN (z) − f (z)| < ε3 for all z in E. Since fN is continuous at z0 there is a δ > 0
such that | fN (z0 ) − fN (z)| < ε3 for all z ∈ E with |z − z0 | < δ . Putting these two
inequalities together and using the triangle inequality, we find for |z − z0 | < δ
| f (z0 ) − f (z)| ≤ | f (z0 ) − fN (z0 )| + | fN (z0 ) − fN (z)| + | fN (z) − f (z)|
ε ε ε
< + + = ε,
3 3 3
which establishes the continuity of f at z0 . Part (ii) follows from (i) by taking fn =
∑nk=1 uk and noting that each fn is continuous, being a finite sum of continuous
functions.

Sometimes we use Theorem 4.1.3 to prove the failure of uniform convergence.
Example 4.1.4. (Failure of uniform convergence) A sequence of functions is
defined on the closed unit disk by

n|z| if |z| ≤ 1n ,
fn (z) =
1
if 1n ≤ |z| ≤ 1.
Does the sequence converge uniformly on |z| ≤ 1?
Solution. The function fn with n = 5 is
depicted in Figure 4.3. It is clear that each
fn is continuous on {z ∈ C : |z| ≤ 1} and

1 if 0 < |z| ≤ 1,
lim fn (z) =
0 if z = 0.
n→∞
Since the limit function is not continuous
at z = 0, we conclude from Theorem 4.1.3
that { fn }∞
n=1 cannot converge uniformly
on any set containing 0; in particular, it
does not converge uniformly in |z| ≤ 1. 

If a sequence of continuous functions converges uniformly to a limit, then the

Then ∑∞
n=1 un converges uniformly and absolutely on E.
Proof. The absolute convergence of ∑∞
n=1 un follows from (i) and (ii) by comparison to the series ∑∞
n=1 Mn . Absolute convergence implies convergence, so we
set ∑∞
n=1 un (z) = s(z) for all z in E. We next prove the uniform convergence. Let

Sequences and Series of Analytic Functions
The remaining results of this section concern limits of analytic functions. Based
on the behavior of the geometric series (Example 4.1.9), we study the limit under
the assumption of uniform convergence on closed subdisks. This hypothesis is less
restrictive than uniform convergence. The following is a central result in the theory
of analytic functions. Its proof is a nice application of Morera’s theorem (Theorem 3.8.10).
Theorem 4.1.10. Suppose that { fn }∞
n=1 is a sequence of analytic functions on a
region Ω such that fn → f uniformly on every closed disk contained in Ω . Then
(i) f is analytic on Ω , and
(k)
(ii) for an integer k ≥ 1, fn (z) → f (k) (z) for all z in Ω . Thus, the limit of the kth
derivative is the kth derivative of the limit.
The proof will be facilitated by the following auxiliary result.
Lemma 4.1.11. (i) Suppose that fn → f uniformly on a closed and bounded subset
E of C, and g is a continuous function on E. Then fn g → f g uniformly on E.
(ii) Suppose that the series u = ∑∞
n=1 un converges uniformly on a closed and
bounded set E, and g is a continuous function on E. Then the series gu = ∑∞
n=1 gun
converges uniformly on E.
Proof. (i) Since g is continuous on E and E is closed and bounded, it follows that g
is bounded on E. Let M = maxz∈E |g(z)|. For all z in E, we have
| fn (z)g(z) − f (z)g(z)| = | fn (z) − f (z)||g(z)| ≤ M| fn (z) − f (z)|.

Thus
max | fn (z)g(z) − f (z)g(z)| ≤ M max | fn (z) − f (z)| → 0,
because fn converges uniformly to f on E. Thus fn g → f g uniformly on E. To prove
(ii), apply (i) to the sequence of partial sums u1 + · · · + un which converges to u. 
Proof (Theorem 4.1.10). (i) The function f is continuous by Theorem 4.1.3(i). To
prove that f is analytic, we apply Morera’s theorem (Theorem 3.8.10). Let γ be
an arbitrary
closed triangular path lying in a closed disk in Ω . It is enough to

show that γ f (z) dz = 0. We have γ fn (z) dz = 0 for all n, by Cauchy’s theorem
inside and on γ , and by Theorem 4.1.5,
(Theorem 3.5.4),
because fn is analytic

(ii) Let z0 ∈ Ω and let BR (z0 ) be a closed disk contained in Ω , centered at z0 with
radius R > 0, with positively oriented boundary CR (z0 ). Since fn → f uniformly on
CR (z0 ) and (z−z1)k+1 is continuous on CR (z0 ), it follows from Lemma 4.1.11(i) that

fn (z)

Theorem 4.1.10 may fail if we replace analytic functions by differentiable functions of a real variable. That is, if E is a subset of the real line and fn (x) → f (x)
uniformly on E, it does not follow in general that fn converges to f , as the next
example shows.
Example 4.1.12. (Failure of termwise differentiation) For 0 ≤ x ≤ 2π and n =
inx
1, 2, . . . define fn (x) = ein . It is clear that fn → 0 uniformly on [0, 2π ]. But
fn (x) = einx and this sequence does not converge except at x = 0 or x = 2π . (See
Example 1.5.9) Consequently, fn does not converge to 0. Can we understand how
this occurs within the larger framework of complex functions? Replace x by z and
inz
consider the sequence functions fn (z) = ein . We cannot find a complex neighborhood of the real interval [0, 2π ] where fn converges, as such a neighborhood would
contain z with Im z < 0. Thus Theorem 4.1.10 does not apply.

There is an important technique in analysis that is manifested in Theorem 4.1.10,
Corollary 4.1.13, and Example 4.1.14. We only have uniform convergence of a
series on closed and bounded subsets of a region Ω , but we infer that the series
can be differentiated termwise on the entire open set Ω .

convergent on all closed and bounded

4.2 Power Series
Definition 4.2.1. A power series is a series of the form
∞

∑ cn (z − z0 )n ,

n=0

where z is a complex variable, z0 is a fixed complex number called the center, and
cn are complex numbers called the coefficients.
We adhere to the usual notational convention that (z − z0 )0 = 1 for all z. A power
series always converges at the center z = z0 because all the terms vanish for n ≥ 1.
The term with n = 0 may not vanish but produces the constant c0 . For z = z0 the
power series may converge or diverge. Let us consider a few examples.
Example 4.2.2. Study the convergence of the power series:

If supm≥n xm = ∞ for all n ≥ 1, then we set lim sup xn = ∞.
The existence of a limit superior follows from the completeness of the real number system. It is easy to show that if L = lim xn exists, then L = lim sup xn . Moreover, lim sup xn coincides with the largest limit of a convergent subsequence2 of
∞
the sequence {xn }∞
n=1 . Since {supm≥n xm }n=1 is a convergent decreasing sequence,
in explicit calculations, it is convenient to find the limit superior as the limit of a
subsequence of {supm≥n xm }∞
n=1 that can be easily calculated.
Example 4.2.4. (a) Let xn = 1 + 1n if n is even and xn = 1n if n is odd. Then {xn }∞
n=1

does not converge, but one has that lim sup xn = 1, since sup{xm : m ≥ 2n} = 1 + 2n

Theorem 4.2.5 illustrates a typical dichotomy of power series. This behavior is
determined by the number R > 0 with the property that the power series converges
for |z − z0 | < R and diverges for |z − z0 | > R.

Definition 4.2.6. The number R in all cases
of Theorem 4.2.5 is called the radius of convergence of the series. As a convention, the
radius of convergence is ∞ in case (ii) and
0 in case (i). In case (iii), the open disk
|z − z0 | < R is called the disk of convergence
and the circle |z − z0 | = R the circle of convergence.

n
Remark 4.2.7. The radius of convergence of a power series ∑∞
n=0 cn (z − z0 ) is
unique. Indeed, if there were two radii of convergence R and R , then for any point
z with R < |z − z0 | < R the power series would have to both converge and diverge
at z, which is impossible.

n
Example 4.2.8. (Cauchy-Hadamard formula) For the series ∑∞

f (k) (z) =

∑ n(n − 1) · · · (n − k + 1)cn (z − z0 )n−k .

(4.2.6)

n=k

Proof. Since the power series (4.2.5) converges uniformly on all closed subdisks of
BR (z0 ), it follows from Corollary 4.1.13 that f is analytic on BR (z0 ) and that the
power series can be differentiated term by term as many times as necessary. Thus,

for all integers k ≥ 1 and all z in BR (z0 ), (4.2.6) holds.
If we evaluate (4.2.6) at z = z0 , all the terms in the series vanish except when
k!
n = k and we get f (k) (z0 ) = (k−k)!
ck = k!ck . Solving for ck , we get

is known as the Taylor’s formula. A consequence of this formula is the following
useful result.

4.3 Taylor Series
In the previous section, we showed that a power series is analytic on its disk of
convergence. In this section, we prove essentially the converse that every analytic
function can be expressed as a power series when restricted to a disk contained in
its domain of analyticity. We are going to achieve this goal by reducing matters to
the expansion of the geometric series

Theorem 4.3.1. Suppose that f is analytic in a region Ω and z0 is in Ω . Let BR (z0 )
be the largest open disk centered at z0 and contained in Ω . Then f has the following
Taylor series expansion around z0
f (z) =

∞

f (n) (z0 )
(z − z0 )n ,
n!

∑

n=0

|z − z0 | < R.

(4.3.2)

Moreover, the expansion is unique in the following sense: If the uniformly convern
gent [on the closed subdisks of BR (z0 )] series ∑∞
n=0 an (z − z0 ) equals f (z) for all z
in BR (z0 ), then we must have an =

f (n) (z0 )
n!

for all n = 0, 1, 2, . . . .

(n)

Remark 4.3.2. The coefficient f n!(z0 ) is called the nth Taylor coefficient of f . Taylor series are named after the English mathematician Brook Taylor (1685–1731),
who wrote about them in 1715. The idea of expanding a function by a power series
was known to mathematicians before Taylor and appeared in the work of Sir Isaac
Newton (1643–1727), the Scottish mathematician James Gregory (1638–1675),
and the Swiss mathematician Johann Bernoulli (1667–1748). Maclaurin series are
named after the Scottish mathematician Colin Maclaurin (1698–1746), who used
them and acknowledged that they are special cases of Taylor series. When z0 = 0 in
Theorem 4.3.1, the series is called the Maclaurin series of f .
Proof (Theorem 4.3.1). We show that f has a power series expansion that converges
uniformly on a closed subdisk Bρ (z0 ) of BR (z0 ). Let 0 < ρ < R. Pick r > 0 such that
ρ < r < R. Since f is analytic inside and on Cr (z0 ), Cauchy’s formula implies that
f (z) =

which completes the first part of the proof. The uniqueness of the power series is a
consequence of Theorem 4.2.10.

Remark 4.3.3. Since there is no guarantee that Ω is the largest region on which
the function f in Theorem 4.3.1 is defined, the series (4.3.2) may converge on an
open disk BR1 (z0 ) larger than BR (z0 ). Since a Taylor series is a power series, it
follows from Theorem 4.2.5(iii) that the series (4.3.2) converges to f (z) absolutely
on BR1 (z0 ) and uniformly on all closed subdisks of BR (z0 ) (in fact all closed subdisks
of BR1 (z0 ).) Also, in view of Corollary 4.2.9, the series may be differentiated term by
term in BR (z0 ) as many times as we wish. This yields the Taylor series representation
of the nth derivative

expansions of (a) ez , (b) cos z, (c) sin z.

(a) Recall that the exponential function was defined as the power series: ez = ∑∞

which converges for all complex numbers z. So this is the Maclaurin series expansion of ez . Let us confirm this using Theorem 4.3.1. If f (z) = ez , then f (n) (z) = ez ,
so f (n) (0) = 1 for all n. Therefore, as expected, the Maclaurin series is

Example 4.3.4 shows the advantage of complex Taylor series over their real counterparts. A real Taylor series converges if and only if a certain remainder goes to
zero. In the complex case, the remainder is irrelevant; the Taylor series will converge in the largest disk that you can fit inside the domain of definition of the analytic function.

As cos x = ∑∞
n=0 (−1) (2n)! , sin x = ∑n=0 (−1) (2n+1)! for −∞ < x < ∞, isn’t it
reasonable to expect that the series for cos z and sin z are obtained by merely replacing x by z? The answer is affirmative and we have the following useful result, which
will allow us to turn well-known Taylor series from calculus into Taylor series of
complex-valued functions.

Proposition 4.3.5. Suppose that f (x) = ∑∞
n=0 cn x is a Taylor series that converges
for all x ∈ (−R, R). Suppose that g is an analytic function on |z| < ρ and g(x) = f (x)
for all real numbers x in some open interval that contains 0. Then the Taylor series
n
of g is g(z) = ∑∞
n=0 cn z for all |z| < ρ .

(n)
g(z) = ∑∞
n=0 n! z . We can compute the derivatives g (0) by taking limits as
z → 0 with z = x real, and since g = f in an open interval that contains 0, we must
have g(n) (0) = f (n) (0) for all n. So the coefficients in the Taylor series of f and g
are the same.

its Maclaurin series ∑n=0 (−1) x converges only for |x| < 1. While it is difficult

complex analysis: 1+x
2 is the restriction to the real line of 1+z2 , and since 1+z2 is not

in view of Proposition 4.3.5, the Maclaurin series of 1+x
2 cannot converge outside
|x| < 1.

We have used (4.3.1), with w = 1−i

equivalently,√|z − i| < |1 − i| = 2. This confirms that the radius of convergence of

the series is 2, as we surmised earlier.

Solution. The function is analytic for all z except when 4 − iz = 0 or z = −4i. Its
Taylor series about z0 = 3 converges in the disk centered at 3 and reaching as far
as −4i. Since the distance from 3 to −4i is 5, we conclude the radius of convergence of the series should be 5. To find the Taylor series, we use ideas similar to

Example 4.3.9. (Expanding about points other than 0) Find the Taylor series representation of sin z and cos z about a point z0 .
Solution. Begin by writing
sin(z) = sin(z − z0 + z0 ) = cos(z0 ) sin(z − z0 ) + sin(z0 ) cos(z − z0 ) (4.3.5)
cos(z) = cos(z − z0 + z0 ) = cos(z0 ) cos(z − z0 ) − sin(z0 ) sin(z − z0 ). (4.3.6)
It follows from (4.3.5) and (4.3.6) that

Factoring Zeros and Extending Analytic Functions
When a polynomial p has a zero at z0 , we can write p(z) = (z − z0 )g(z), where g is
another polynomial. In particular, the function p(z)/(z − z0 ) (which equals g(z) for
all z = z0 ) can be made analytic even at z0 by defining it to be g(z0 ) at z0 . The same
is true for analytic functions in general.

Proof. Clearly g is analytic for all z = z0 in Ω . To show that g is analytic at z0 , let
BR (z0 ) be an open disk contained in Ω . We know from Theorem 4.3.1 that f has a
Taylor series expansion about z0 that converges in BR (z0 ). So

38. Project Problem: The Catalan numbers. The Catalan numbers are named after the French
mathematician Eugène Charles Catalan (1814–1894). They arise in many combinatorics problems,
such as the following:
• The number of ways in which parentheses can be placed in a sequence of numbers to be multiplied, two at a time.
• The number of ways a polygon with n+1 sides can be cut into n−1 triangles by nonintersecting
diagonals.
• The number of paths of length 2(n − 1) through an n by n grid that connect two diagonally
opposite vertices that stay below or on the main diagonal.
Denote the nth Catalan number by cn . Take the first interpretation of these numbers, and say we
have a sequence of three numbers a, b, c. We can multiply them two at a time in exactly two
ways: ((ab)c) and (a(bc)). Thus c3 = 2. With a sequence of four numbers, we can have (((ab)c)d)
or ((ab)(cd)) or ((a(bc))d) or (a((bc)d)) or (a(b(cd))). Thus c4 = 5. In general, if we have a
sequence of n numbers, we can break it into two subsequences of k and n − k numbers. Then
each arrangement of parentheses from the k sequence can be combined with an arrangement of
parentheses of the n − k sequence to yield an arrangement of parentheses of the n-sequence. Since

260

we have ck possibilities for the k-sequence and cn−k possibilities for the (n − k)-sequence, we get
this way ck × cn−k possibilities for the n-sequence. But this can be done for k = 1, 2, . . . , n − 1, and
so we have the recursion relation
cn =

∑ ck cn−k ,

for n ≥ 2.

We have c2 = 1, and we will take c1 = 1 (for reference, c0 = 0). Our goal in this exercise is to

41. Analytic continuation. We briefly visit discuss the topic of analytic continuation. By constructing a Taylor series of a function f about z0 , we create a function g analytic on some disk
centered at z0 , such that g and f coincide near z0 . If g is defined in a region where f is not, or if g
has different values than f away from z0 , g is said to be an analytic continuation of f .
As a somewhat contrived example, suppose that ez is defined only for |z| < 1. Can we find a
function that coincides with ez on the unit disk but is analytic elsewhere? It is clear that we can (just
define the exponential function on C), but let us see how we can get this from series expansions.
zn
z
The Maclaurin series of ez is g(z) = ∑∞
n=0 n! , which converges for all z. Thus g(z) = e for all z is
an analytic continuation of f (z). We now present a more interesting case of analytic continuation
of logarithm branches.

4.4 Laurent Series

(a) Show that the Taylor expansion of the principal
branch of the logarithm f (z) = Log z about the point

(b) Show√that the radius of convergence of the Taylor
series is 2. Thus g is analytic in the disk
√
|z + 1 − i| < 2 .
See Figure 4.9. it is important to note that this crosses
the branch cut of f , but not the branch point (the origin). On the upper side of the branch cut, g coincides
with f , but on the lower side of the branch cut, g does
not coincide with f .

i
x
Fig. 4.9 The Taylor series expansion of Log z around −1
√ + i has
radius of convergence 2.

To see this, consider the branch f1 (z) = log− π z. Since f = f1 in a neighborhood of z0 , their
4
√
Taylor expansions about z0 will be the same, and since f1 is analytic on the disk |z + 1 − i| < 2,
Theorem 4.3.1 says that g must equal f1 in this disk. Thus, for z in the part of the disk above
the branch cut (quadrants 1 and 2) we have g(z) = f1 (z) = f (z), but for z in the part of the disk
below the branch cut (quadrant 3) we have g(z) = f1 (z) = f (z) + 2π i. The Taylor expansion of f
analytically continues the function into quadrant 3 where arg z > π , and the analytic continuation
is different from the original function.

4.4 Laurent Series
We saw in the previous section that if a function is analytic in a disk centered at
a point z0 , then it has a Taylor series representation in that disk. There is a similar series representation in terms of both positive and negative powers of (z − z0 )
for functions that are analytic in annular regions around a point z0 . These series
are known as Laurent series, after the French engineer and mathematician Pierre
Alphonse Laurent (1813–1854), who discovered them around 1842.
For 0 ≤ R1 < R2 ≤ ∞ we define the annular region (or annulus)
AR R z

See Figure 4.10 for an illustration where R1
and R2 are nonzero and finite. Note that the
annulus AR1 ,R2 (z0 ) degenerates into a punctured disk with z0 removed when R1 = 0 and
R2 < ∞, a punctured plane with z0 removed
when R1 = 0, R2 = ∞, or a plane with a disk
centered at z0 cut out of it when 0 < R1 and
R2 = ∞. These sets still count as annuli by our
definition.

annulus ρ1 ≤ |z − z0 | ≤ ρ2 where R1 < ρ1 and ρ2 < R2 . The series in (4.4.1) is

Proof. We show that the series (4.4.1) converges absolutely and uniformly on closed
annuli ρ1 ≤ |z − z0 | ≤ ρ2 , where R1 < ρ1 and ρ2 < R2 . Fixing such ρ1 and ρ2 , pick
r1 and r2 such that

to that in (4.4.2).
Finally we show uniqueness of the Laurent expansion (4.4.1). Suppose that on
the annulus R1 < |z − z0 | < R2 the function f has two Laurent series:

In the previous examples, we were given the function and the annular region on
which it is analytic. If the region is not known and we are asked to find a Laurent
series expansion about a point, our first step would be to determine the annular
regions on which the function is analytic. As the next example illustrates, to each
region there corresponds a different Laurent series.

Solution. This problem has two parts. First we must determine how many different Laurent series expansions the function has around 0. Then we must find these
Laurent series. To answer the first question, we look for the largest disjoint annular
regions around z0 = 0 on which the function is analytic. Obviously, it is analytic at

disk, and so we use a power series expansion there, which is really a special case of
a Laurent series expansion without negative powers (Theorem 4.3.1).

Differentiation and Integration of Laurent Series
Consider a Laurent series (4.4.1) in the annulus AR1 ,R2 (z0 ). Since each term of the
series, an (z − z0 )n , is analytic on the annulus AR1 ,R2 (z0 ), and the series converges
uniformly on all subannuli of AR1 ,R2 (z0 ), we can integrate or differentiate term by
term the series as many times as we want in the annulus AR1 ,R2 (z0 ). So, for example,
differentiating the Laurent series (4.4.1) once, for R1 < |z − z0 | < R2 , we obtain
f (z) =

because of the singularity of the function e1/z at the point z0 = 0 which lies inside
the path. The idea is to expand the integrand (or part of the integrand) in a Laurent
series in an annulus that contains the path, and then integrate term by term.

4.5 Zeros and Singularities
In this section, we use Taylor and Laurent series to study the zeros and singular
points of analytic functions. To motivate the first result, suppose that p is a polynomial and p(z0 ) = 0, then we can factor the highest power of (z − z0 ) out of p(z)
and write p(z) = q(z)(z − z0 )m , where q is a polynomial with q(z0 ) = 0. It is also
straightforward to check that p( j) (z0 ) = 0 for all j = 0, 1, . . . , m − 1.
Definition 4.5.1. Let Ω be a region, let f be an analytic function defined on Ω , and
let z0 ∈ Ω . Let m ≥ 1 be an integer. The complex number z0 is called a zero of order
m of f if there is another analytic function g defined in a neighborhood of z0 such
that g(z0 ) = 0 and

4.5 Zeros and Singularities

273

f (z) = (z − z0 )m g(z)
for all z in this neighborhood. If m = 1, we call z0 a simple zero of f . The zero z0 is
called isolated if there is a neighborhood of z0 in Ω such that z0 is the only zero of
f in this neighborhood.
Theorem 4.5.2. Suppose that f is analytic on a region Ω that contains a point z0
and f (z0 ) = 0. Then exactly one of the following two assertions holds:
(i) f is identically zero in a neighborhood of z0 .
(ii) z0 is an isolated zero of f .
Moreover, if (ii) holds, then there are an integer m ≥ 1, a real number r > 0, and
an analytic function λ on Br (z0 ) such that λ (z) = 0 for all z ∈ Br (z0 ) and
f (z) = (z − z0 )m λ (z)

for all z ∈ Br (z0 ).

Consequently, z0 is a zero of order m and we have
f (z0 ) = f (z0 ) = · · · = f (m−1) (z0 ) = 0,

f (m) (z0 ) = 0.

n
Proof. Since f is analytic at z0 , it has a Taylor series, f (z) = ∑∞
n=0 an (z − z0 ) , centered at z0 , and convergent in an open disk BR (z0 ) contained in Ω . Theorem 4.3.1
gives that ak = f (k) (z0 )/k!. There are two possibilities: either (i) an = 0 for all
n = 0, 1, 2, . . . , or (ii) there exists an n such that an = 0. We show that these two possibilities correspond to the mutually exclusive assertions (i) and (ii) of the theorem.
Clearly, if an = 0 for all n, then f is identically equal to zero on the disk BR (z0 ).
Now if an = 0 for some n, then there is a coefficient am with a least index m such
that am = 0; then a0 = a1 = · · · = am−1 = 0. Thus we obtain

f (z0 ) = f (z0 ) = · · · = f (m−1) (z0 ) = 0
and
f (m) (z0 ) = 0.
For |z − z0 | < R, write
f (z) = am (z − z0 )m + am+1 (z − z0 )m+1 + am+2 (z − z0 )m+2 + · · ·


= (z − z0 )m am + am+1 (z − z0 ) + am+2 (z − z0 )2 + · · ·
= (z − z0 )m λ (z),
where

λ (z) = am + am+1 (z − z0 ) + am+2 (z − z0 )2 + · · · ,
and am = 0. Since λ (z) is a convergent power series in |z − z0 | < R, it defines an
analytic function in view of Corollary 4.2.9. Also, λ (z0 ) = am = 0 and λ is continuous at z0 , so we can find a neighborhood Br (z0 ) of z0 such that λ (z) = 0 for all z in
Br (z0 ).


274

4 Series of Analytic Functions and Singularities

Example 4.5.3. (Order of zeros) Find the order m of the zero of sin z at z0 = 0; then
express sin z = zm λ (z), where λ is analytic and satisfies λ (0) = 0.
Solution. Clearly, 0 is a zero of sin z. The order of the zero is equal to the order of
the first nonvanishing derivative of f (z) = sin z at 0. Since f (z) = cos z and cos 0 =
1 = 0, we conclude that the order of the zero at 0 is 1. We have for all z

z 2 z4
z3 z5
sin z = z − + − · · · = z 1 − + − · · · = zλ (z),
3! 5!
3! 5!

where λ (z) = 1− z3! + z5! −· · · . The function λ (z) is entire (because it is a convergent
power series for all z), and λ (0) = 1. Also, for z = 0, λ (z) = sinz z , which is entire by
Example 4.3.10.

We now address the following question: Suppose that a function is analytic and not
identically zero on a region. Can it have zeros that are not isolated? The answer is
no, and this depends on the fact that the region is connected.
Theorem 4.5.4. An nonzero analytic function defined on a region has isolated zeros.
Proof. Let f be an analytic function defined on a region Ω . Define the subsets

Ω0 = {z ∈ Ω : f (z) = 0 and z is not isolated}
Ω1 = {z ∈ Ω : f (z) = 0} ∪ {z ∈ Ω : f (z) = 0 and z is isolated}.
Then Ω0 and Ω1 are disjoint sets whose union is Ω . We show that Ω0 and Ω1 are
open; then by the connectedness of Ω (Proposition 2.1.7) we have either Ω = Ω0
or Ω = Ω1 . If Ω = Ω0 , then every point in Ω is a zero of f ; in this case f vanishes
everywhere on Ω . If Ω = Ω1 then every point of Ω is either not a zero or an isolated
zero of f . In this case all zeros of f are isolated.
If w ∈ Ω0 , then assertion (ii) in Theorem 4.5.2 does not hold, hence assertion
(i) must hold and thus f vanishes identically in some neighborhood Br (w). Clearly,
all the points in Br (w) are not isolated zeros of f , so Br (w) is contained in Ω0 .
This shows that Ω0 is open in this case. Now let w ∈ Ω1 . If f (w) = 0, then there
is a neighborhood of w on which f is nonvanishing; this neighborhood is contained
in Ω1 . If f (w) = 0 and w is an isolated zero, then Theorem 4.5.2 guarantees the
existence of a neighborhood Bδ (w) of w on which f has no zeros except the isolated
one at w. This neighborhood is also contained in Ω1 , since Bδ (w) = Bδ (w) \ {w} is

contained in {z ∈ Ω : f (z) = 0}. Thus Ω1 is open.
Theorem 4.5.5. (Identity Principle) Suppose that f , g are analytic functions on a
region Ω . If {zn }∞
n=1 is an sequence of distinct points in Ω with f (zn ) = g(zn ) for
all n and zn → z0 ∈ Ω , then f (z) = g(z) for all z ∈ Ω .
Proof. If zn is a zero of f − g in Ω and zn → z0 as n → ∞, then f (zn ) = g(zn ) for all
n and by continuity it follows that

4.5 Zeros and Singularities

275

f (z0 ) = f ( lim zn ) = lim f (zn ) = lim g(zn ) = g( lim zn ) = g(z0 )
n→∞

n→∞

n→∞

n→∞

and thus z0 is zero of f − g. But obviously z0 is not an isolated zero. By Theorem 4.5.2, f − g is identically zero on Ω .

In many interesting applications of Theorem 4.5.5 the functions f and g are equal
on an interval [a, b] of the real line, or on a whole disk BR (z0 ). Such sets clearly
contain infinite sequences of points that converge to a point in the set itself.
Example 4.5.6. (Applications of the identity principle) (a) Recall the identity
cos2 z + sin2 z = 1 valid for all complex numbers z; see (1.7.9) in Proposition 1.7.3.
We prove this identity using Theorem 4.5.5 and the fact that it holds for real
numbers z. Let f (z) = cos2 z + sin2 z and g(z) = 1. Clearly, f and g are entire, and
for real z = x, we have f (x) = sin2 x + cos2 x = 1 = g(x). Since f (z) = g(z) for all z
on the real line, which contains infinite converging sequences, we infer from Theorem 4.5.5 that f (z) = g(z) for all z; that is, cos2 z + sin2 z = 1.
(b) Modifying the method in (a), we can prove identities involving two or more
variables. As an illustration, let us prove that for all complex numbers z1 and z2 ,
cos(z1 + z2 ) = cos z1 cos z2 − sin z1 sin z2 .

(4.5.1)

In a first step, let z2 = x2 be an arbitrary real number. Let f (z) = cos(z + x2 ) and
g(z) = cos z cos x2 − sin z sin x2 . Clearly, f and g are entire, and from the addition
formula for the cosines, we have f (x) = g(x) for all real x. Hence by Theorem 4.5.5,
we have f (z) = g(z) for all z; equivalently,
cos(z + x2 ) = cos z cos x2 − sin z sin x2

for all complex z.

(4.5.2)

Now fix z1 and define F(z2 ) = cos(z1 + z2 ) and G(z2 ) = cos z1 cos z2 − sin z1 sin z2 .
Here again, F and G are entire (as functions of z2 ) and (4.5.2) states that F and G
agree on the real line. By Theorem 4.5.5, F(z2 ) = G(z2 ) for all complex z2 , implying
that (4.5.1) holds.

To establish other useful consequences regarding the number of zeros of an analytic functions, we need a topological property of complex numbers known as the
Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem. This states the following: Let S denote a closed and
bounded subset of C, and let {wn }∞
n=1 be a sequence formed by elements of S. Then
of
{wn }∞
there is a subsequence {znk }∞
n=1 that converges to a point z0 in S. See
k=1
Appendix, page 484.
Corollary 4.5.7. An analytic function defined on a bounded region that admits a
continuous extension on its closure and is nonvanishing on the boundary of the
region has at most finitely many zeros.

276

4 Series of Analytic Functions and Singularities

Proof. The closure Ω of a region Ω is the region Ω together with its boundary.
If Ω is bounded, then Ω is closed and bounded. Suppose that f is a function as
in the statement of the theorem and suppose that it has infinitely many zeros in
Ω ; then by the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem, there is an infinite sequence of zeros,
{zn }∞
n=1 in Ω that converges to a point z0 in Ω . Since f is continuous in Ω , f (z0 ) =
limn→∞ f (zn ) = 0, and since f is nonvanishing on the boundary, we conclude that
z0 lies in Ω . Hence by Theorem 4.5.5, f is identically zero on Ω , and since f is
continuous, f must be zero on the boundary, which is a contradiction. Hence f can

have at most finitely many zeros in Ω .

Isolated Singularities
If a function is analytic in a neighborhood of a point z0 except possibly at the pointz0 ,
then z0 is called an isolated singularity of the function. There are only three different types of isolated singularities, which are defined as follows.
Definition 4.5.8. Suppose that z0 is an isolated singularity of an analytic function f
defined in a deleted neighborhood of z0 . Then
(i) z0 is a removable singularity of f if the function can be redefined at z0 to be
analytic there.
(ii) z0 is a pole of f if lim | f (z)| = ∞.
z→z0

(iii) z0 is an essential singularity of f if it is neither a pole nor a removable singularity.
(b) Pole.
(a) Removable singularity.

(c) Essential singularity.

Fig. 4.18 Near an essential singularity, | f | is neither

graph behaves erratically.

When redefining f at a removable singularity z0 , we set f (z0 ) = limz→z0 f (z);
otherwise, f would not be continuous and hence could not be analytic at z0 . Note
that when z0 is a removable singularity, f must be bounded near z0 (Figure 4.16).
The singularity is a pole if the graph of | f | blows up to infinity as we approach z0
(Figure 4.17). It is harder to explain the graph of an essential singularity, but as the

4.5 Zeros and Singularities

277

function is neither bounded nor tends to infinity as we approach z0 (Figure 4.18),
its behavior is quite erratic. We provide equivalent characterizations of each type of
singularity after we take a look at some examples.
Example 4.5.9. (Three types of singularities)
2 −1
(a) The function f (z) = zz−1
(z = 1) is analytic everywhere, except at z0 = 1. So

z0 = 1 is an isolated singularity. For z = 1, f (z) = (z−1)(z+1)
= z + 1. By defining
z−1
f (1) = 2, we make f analytic at z = 1. This shows that the singularity at z0 = 1 is
removable.
(b) Consider the function
z2
.
g(z) =
(z − i)3

It has an isolated singularity at z = i. Unlike the previous example, the singularity
here is not removable; it is a pole. Since
|z|2
= ∞,
z→i |z − i|3

lim |g(z)| = lim
z→i

the graph of |g| has a pole that blows up to infinity above the singularity z0 = i.
(c) Consider
1
z = 0.
h(z) = e z ,
We have an isolated singularity at z0 = 0. We will show that it is an essential singularity by eliminating the possibility of the other two types. Suppose that z = x is real
and tends to 0 from the right. Then
1

1

lim |e z | = lim e x = ∞.

z=x↓0

x↓0

So 0 cannot be a removable singularity. Now suppose that z = x is real and tends to
0 from the left. Then
1
1
lim |e z | = lim e x = 0;
z=x↑0

x↑0

hence 0 cannot be a pole, and so 0 is an essential singularity.



Removable singularities often occur when an analytic function h(z) with a zero
at z0 is divided by a small enough power of (z − z0 ).
Proposition 4.5.10. Let h be analytic on BR (z0 ), R > 0, with a zero of order m ≥ 1
h(z)
at z0 . If p ≤ m is an integer, then f (z) = (z−z
) p has a removable singularity at z0 .
0

Proof. By Theorem 4.5.2(ii), there is some 0 < r ≤ R such that h(z) = (z−z0 )m λ (z)
for |z − z0 | < r, where λ is analytic and nowhere vanishing on Br (z0 ). So for z = z0 ,
f (z) = (z − z0 )m−p λ (z), where m − p ≥ 0. Since in a neighborhood of z0 , f (z) is
equal to the analytic function (z − z0 )m−p λ (z), z0 is a removable singularity.

4 Series of Analytic Functions and Singularities

Example 4.5.11. (Dividing by powers) (a) The function ez−2 − 1 can be expanded
in a Taylor series about z0 = 2 as ez−2 − 1 = (z − 2) + 12 (z − 2)2 + · · · . Clearly, this
function has a zero of order 1 at z0 = 2, so by Proposition 4.5.10 (or just by dividing),
ez−2 −1
z−2 has a removable singularity at z0 = 2.
(b) The function cos z − 1 can be expanded in a Maclaurin series as
1
1
cos z − 1 = − z2 + z4 − · · · .
2
4!
Clearly, this function has a zero of order 2 at 0, so from Proposition 4.5.10, each of
cos z−1
and coszz−1
has a removable singularity at 0.

2
z
We can now give several characterizations of a removable singularity.
Theorem 4.5.12. Suppose that f is analytic on 0 < |z − z0 | < R. The following are
equivalent:
(i) f has a removable singularity at z0 .
(ii) f (z) =

∞

∑ an (z − z0 )n for 0 < |z − z0 | < R.

n=0

(iii) There is a complex number A such that lim f (z) exists and equals A.
z→z0

(iv) lim | f (z)| exists and is finite.
z→z0

(v) f is bounded in a neighborhood of z0 .
(vi) lim (z − z0 ) f (z) = 0.
z→z0

Moreover, if (iii) holds, then the analytic extension of f on the disk |z − z0 | < R
satisfies f (z0 ) = A.
Proof. (i) ⇒ (ii) follows from Theorem 4.3.1, i.e., the existence of a power series
expansion for the analytic extension of f on the disk |z − z0 | < R.
(ii) ⇒ (iii) is a consequence of the fact that power series are continuous; A = a0 .
(iii) ⇒ (iv) follows from the continuity of the absolute value function w → |w|.
(iv) ⇒ (v) is obtained from Theorem 2.2.7, which asserts that if a function has a
limit as z → z0 , then it is bounded in a neighborhood of z0 .
(v) ⇒ (vi) is obtained by the squeeze theorem (Theorem 2.2.5).
(vi) ⇒ (i) Define the function
h(z) =

(z − z0 )2 f (z)
0

when 0 < |z − z0 | < R,
when z = z0 .

Then for z = z0 , h (z) exists and is equal to (z − z0 )2 f (z) + 2(z − z0 ) f (z). Also,

4.5 Zeros and Singularities

279

(z − z0 )2 f (z)
= lim (z − z0 ) f (z) = 0,
z→z0
z→z0
z − z0
lim

hence h (z0 ) exists and is equal to 0. Thus h is analytic on BR (z0 ) and satisfies
h(z0 ) = h (z0 ) = 0. It follows that z0 is a zero of h of order at least 2, since the first
two terms of the power series expansion of h vanish. In view of Proposition 4.5.10,
h(z)
has a removable singularity at z0 .
it follows that f (z) = (z−z
)2
0

Finally, if (iii) holds, then by continuity, the value of f at z0 should be the limit

of f (z) as z → z0 which is A.

Example 4.5.13. (Removable singularities) Show that the functions have removable singularities at the indicated points:
sin z
ez−1 − 1
at z0 = 0;
at z0 = 1.
(a)
(b)
z
z−1
Solution. (a) We have
lim (z − 0) f (z) = lim z

z→0

z→0

sin z
= lim sin z = 0.
z→0
z

Thus sinz z has a removable singularity at z = 0, in view of Theorem 4.5.12(vi).
(b) Again we apply Theorem 4.5.12(vi). We have
lim (z − 1) f (z) = lim (z − 1)

z→1

z→1

ez−1 − 1
= lim (ez−1 − 1) = 0.
z→1
z−1

Hence z0 = 1 is a removable singularity.



In order to characterize poles, we relate a pole of f to a zero of 1f . Let f be
analytic in 0 < |z − z0 | < R, so that z0 is an isolated singularity. Suppose that z0 is
a pole of f . Since limz→z0 | f (z)| = ∞, we can find ρ > 0 such that f (z) = 0 for all
0 < |z − z0 | < ρ . Consider the function

g(z) =

1
f (z)

0

if 0 < |z − z0 | < ρ ,
if z = z0 .

(4.5.3)

Clearly, g is analytic and nonzero on 0 < |z − z0 | < ρ . As limz→z0 g(z) = 0 = g(z0 ), it
follows from Theorem 4.5.12 that g is analytic at z = z0 ; and since g is not identically
0 in a neighborhood of z0 , it follows that z0 is a zero of g. We are now able to define
the order of the pole of f at z0 as the order of the zero of g at z0 .
Definition 4.5.14. Let z0 be a pole of an analytic function f on 0 < |z − z0 | < R.
The order of the pole of f at z0 is defined as the order of the zero of 1f at z = z0 .
We describe equivalent characterizations of poles.

4 Series of Analytic Functions and Singularities

Theorem 4.5.15. Let m ≥ 1 be an integer. Let R > 0 and suppose that f is analytic
on the punctured disk 0 < |z − z0 | < R. Then the following conditions are equivalent:
(i) f has a pole of order m at z0 .
(ii) There is an r > 0 and there is a nowhere vanishing analytic function φ on Br (z0 )
such that
φ (z)
,
when 0 < |z − z0 | < R.
f (z) =
(z − z0 )m
(iii) There exists a complex number α = 0 such that
lim (z − z0 )m f (z) = α .

z→z0

(iv) There exist r > 0 and complex numbers an for n ≥ −m such that a−m = 0 and
f (z) =

+ a0 + a1 (z − z0 ) + a2 (z − z0 )2 + · · ·
(z − z0 )m (z − z0 )m−1
z − z0

for all z ∈ Br (z0 ) \ {z0 }.
Proof. (i) ⇒ (ii). If f has a pole of order m at z0 , then the function g in (4.5.3) has a
zero of order m at z0 . By Theorem 4.5.2, there is a nowhere vanishing function λ on
a neighborhood Br (z0 ) of z0 such that g(z) = (z − z0 )m λ (z). This implies assertion
(ii) with φ = 1/λ .
(ii) ⇒ (iii). This is an easy consequence of the observation that (z−z0 )m f (z) = φ (z)
which converges to φ (z0 ) as z → z0 . Then α = φ (z0 ) = 0 works.
(iii) ⇒ (iv). Using Theorem 4.5.12(iii) we deduce that z0 is a removable singularity
of (z − z0 )m f (z) on the annulus |z − z0 | < r. Expanding q(z) = (z − z0 )m f (z) in a
power series centered at z0 , we write
q(z) =

∞

∑ cn (z − z0 )n ,

|z − z0 | < r,

(4.5.4)

n=0

for some ck with c0 = α . Dividing both sides of (4.5.4) by (z − z0 )m and using that
(z − z0 )m f (z) = q(z) for 0 < |z − z0 | < r, we obtain the claimed Laurent series of f .
Note that ak = ck+m for k ≥ −m and that a−m = α = 0.
(iv) ⇒ (i). Factoring (z−z1 )m from the Laurent series of f (z) in (iv) we write f (z) as

and we note that the expression inside the square brackets is an analytic function on
|z − z0 | < r. This function, which we call h, satisfies h(z0 ) = a−m = 0; thus there is
a neighborhood Bδ (z0 ) of z0 on which it is nowhere vanishing. We have
lim | f (z)| = lim

z→z0

lim |h(z)| = |a−m | · ∞ = ∞

which implies that z0 is a pole of f . Since 1/h does not vanish on Bδ (z0 ), we write
1
1

f (z)
h(z)
and consequently the order of the zero of 1/ f at z0 is m; so the order of the pole z0
of f is also m in view of Definition 4.5.14.

around 0. Since
1
z

lim z2
z→0 z sin z
z→0 sin z
we conclude that 0 is a pole of order 2 of f (z).
(b) We use Laurent series. Since

Thus the order of the pole at 0 is 2.

Having characterized removable singularities and poles in terms of Laurent
series, this leaves one possibility for essential singularities. They must have infinitely
many terms involving negative powers of (z − z0 ). For ease of reference, we list all
three possibilities together.
Theorem 4.5.17. Suppose that f is analytic in a region Ω except for an isolated
singularity at z0 in Ω . Let
f (z) =

4 Series of Analytic Functions and Singularities

denote the Laurent series expansion of f about z0 , which is valid in some annulus
0 < |z − z0 | < R. Then
(i) z0 is a removable singularity ⇔ an = 0 for all n = −1, −2, . . . .
(ii) z0 is a pole of order m ≥ 1 ⇔ a−m = 0 for some m > 0 and an = 0 for all
n < −m.
(iii) z0 is an essential singularity ⇔ an = 0 for infinitely many n < 0.

Example 4.5.18. (Essential
singularities) Classify the isolated singularities of the
z
function f (z) = e sin z .
Solution. The function f is analytic at all points except where sin z = 0; that is,
except when z = kπ , where k is an integer. As it is a bit complicated to find the
Laurent series expansion of f , we use the characterizations of Theorems
4.5.12 and
z
4.5.15. When z = 0, we have limz→0 sinz z = 1, hence limz→0 e sin z = e, and so the
function has a removable singularity at z = 0 by Theorem 4.5.12(iii). We claim that
we have an essential singularity at z = kπ , k = 0. To prove this, we eliminate the
possibility of a removable singularity or a pole. Suppose that k is even. Then it is
easy to see that if z = x is real, then limx↓kπ sinx x = +∞ and limx↑kπ sinx x = −∞. So if
z = x is real, then
x

lim e sin x = ∞,

x↓kπ

z

implying that kπ is not a removable singularity of e sin z . Also,
x

lim e sin x = 0,

x↑kπ
z

implying that kπ is not az pole of e sin z . This leaves only one possibility: kπ is an

essential singularity of e sin z . A similar argument works for odd k.
One way to determine whether an isolated singularity is an essential singularity is
to rule out the possibility of the other two types of singularities. This can be achieved
by showing that the function is unbounded and has different limits as we approach
the isolated singularity in different ways. The following theorem is a useful characterization of essential singularities. The theorem was discovered independently by
Weierstrass and the Italian mathematician Felice Casorati (1835–1890).
Theorem 4.5.19. (Casorati-Weierstrass) Suppose that f is analytic on a punctured disk BR (z0 ). Then z0 is an essential singularity of f if and only if the following
two conditions hold:
(i) There is a sequence {zn }∞
n=1 in BR (z0 ) such that zn → z0 and | f (zn )| → ∞ as
n → ∞.
(ii) For any complex number α , there is a sequence {zn }∞
n=1 in BR (z0 ) (that depends
on α ) such that zn → z0 and f (zn ) → α as n → ∞.

4.5 Zeros and Singularities

283

Remark 4.5.20. Notice that (i) is not saying that limz→z0 | f (z)| = ∞. It is just saying
that you can approach z0 in such a way that | f (z)| will tend to infinity. Similarly, part
(ii) says that you can approach z0 in such a way that f (z) comes arbitrarily close to
any complex value α . In fact, a deep result in complex analysis, known as Picard’s
great theorem, states that, in a neighborhood of an essential singularity, a function
takes on every complex value, with one possible exception, an infinite number of
times.
Proof. If (i) holds, then f is not bounded near z0 , and so z0 is not a removable
singularity. If (ii) holds, then it is not the case that limz→z0 | f (z)| = ∞, and so z0 is
not a pole. Thus (i) and (ii) together imply that z0 is an essential singularity.
Conversely, let z0 be an essential singularity. Since f is not bounded near z0
(otherwise z0 would be a removable singularity), it follows that (i) holds. Now we
prove (ii). Precisely, we show that
∀ n = 1, 2, . . . ∃ zn ∈ B1/n (z0 ) ∩ BR (z0 ) such that | f (zn ) − α | < 1/n.

(4.5.5)

Suppose that (4.5.5) does not hold. Then there is a natural number n such that for all
1
z ∈ B1/n (z0 )∩BR (z0 ) we have | f (z)− α | ≥ 1/n. Consider the function g(z) = f (z)−
α
defined for z ∈ B1/n (z0 ) ∩ BR (z0 ). Then |g(z)| ≤ n on its domain and so z0 is a
removable singularity for g, by Theorem 4.5.12(v). Also, since limz→z0 | f (z)| = ∞,
1
+ α , which is
we conclude that g(z0 ) = 0. Solving for f (z), we find f (z) = g(z)
analytic in a neighborhood of z0 , since g(z0 ) = 0. This is a contradiction. Hence
statement (4.5.5) is valid. Consequently, there are zn satisfying 0 < |zn − z0 | < 1/n

such that | f (zn ) − α | < 1/n; then (ii) follows by letting n → ∞.

Example 4.5.21. (Casorati-Weierstrass) Suppose α is a complex number. Find a
1/zn → α as n → ∞. Also
sequence {zn }∞
n=1 that converges to 0 as n → ∞ such that e
1/z
find a sequence zn → 0 such that |e n | → ∞ as n → ∞.
Solution. If α is not a negative real number, choose zn = ( Log α + 2π in)−1 . If α is a
negative real number, choose zn = ( Log (iα ) + 2π in − π2i )−1 . The sequence {zn }∞
n=1
tends to zero in each case but e1/zn = α for all n. If α = 0 choose zn = −1/n; then

e1/zn → 0 as n → ∞. As already observed, for α = ∞, zn = 1/n works.
We end the section by extending the definitions of zeros and singularities to the
point at infinity. If f is analytic on a neighborhood of infinity, i.e., f is analytic for
all |z| > R, then f 1z is analytic in the annulus 0 < |z| < R1 and hence it has an
isolated singularity at 0. With this in mind, we make the following definitions.
Definition 4.5.22. Suppose that f is analytic for all |z| > R. Then f has
 
a removable singularity at ∞ if f 1z has a removable singularity at 0;
 
a pole of order m at ∞ if f 1z has a pole of order m at 0;
 
an essential singularity at ∞ if f 1z has a essential singularity at 0.

4 Series of Analytic Functions and Singularities

When f has a removable singularity at ∞, limz→∞ f (z) exists. When limz→∞ f (z) =
0, we say that f has a zero at ∞.
Example 4.5.23. (Singularities at ∞) Characterize all entire functions with a pole
of order m ≥ 1 at ∞.
Solution. Let f be an entire function with a pole of order m ≥ 1 at ∞. This function
1
n
has a Maclaurin series f (z) = ∑∞
n=0 cn z that converges for allz. For z = 0, f z =

1
∑∞
n=0 zn . Appealing to Theorem 4.5.15(iv), we see that f z has a pole of order
m ≥ 1 at 0 if and only if cm = 0 and cn = 0 for all n > m, in other words, if and only
if f is a polynomial of degree m. Consequently, f has a pole of order m ≥ 1 at ∞ if
and only if f is a polynomial of degree m.

(b) Express the Laurent series expansion of f ( 1z ) around 0 by replacing z by 1z in the Maclaurin
series expansion of f . Using part (a), conclude that f must be constant.

35. Prove the following assertions concerning zeros and isolated singularities:
(a) If f has a zero of order m ≥ 0 at z0 and g has a zero of order n ≥ 0 at z0 , then f g has a
zero of order m + n at z0 . (Here we take a zero of order 0 to mean analytic and nonvanishing in a
neighborhood of z0 .)
(b) If f has a pole of order m ≥ 1 at z0 and g has a zero of order n ≥ 1 at z0 , then at z0 , f g has a
pole of order m − n if m > n; a zero of order n − m if n > m, and a removable singularity if m = n.
(c) If f has a removable singularity at z0 and g is analytic at z0 , then f g has a removable singularity
at z0 .
(d) If f has an essential singularity at z0 and g is not identically 0 with a removable singularity
or a pole at z0 , then f g has an essential singularity at z0 . [Hint: Multiply or divide by suitable
(z − z0 )m so that g(z) is analytic and nonvanishing in a neighborhood of z0 ; use Exercise 34.] Does
the assertion remain true if g has an essential singularity at z0 ?

4.6 Schwarz’s Lemma
In this section we put together some of the material we have developed to prove
a very elegant and useful lemma attributed to Karl Hermann Amandus Schwarz
(1843–1921). This lemma reflects the rigidity of analytic functions from the unit
disk to itself and has remarkable applications.
Lemma 4.6.1. (Schwarz’s Lemma) Suppose that f is analytic on the open unit
disk B1 (0) with f (0) = 0 and that f takes values in the closed unit disk B1 (0); i.e.,
it satisfies | f (z)| ≤ 1 for all |z| < 1. Then we have
| f (z)| ≤ |z| for all |z| < 1

(4.6.1)

| f (0)| ≤ 1.

(4.6.2)

and
Moreover, if either (a) equality holds in (4.6.1) for some z = 0 (i.e., there is a z0 = 0
with |z0 | < 1 such that | f (z0 )| = |z0 |) or (b) equality holds in (4.6.2), then there is a
complex constant A with |A| = 1 such that
f (z) = Az
for all |z| < 1.
Proof. Consider the function
g(w) =

f (w)
w

if w = 0,

f (0)

if w = 0.

(4.6.3)

It follows from Theorem 4.5.12(iii) that g has a removable singularity and hence is
analytic on the open unit disk. Fix a point z in B1 (0) and let R satisfy |z| < R < 1.
Then the function g is analytic on the open disk BR (0) and is continuous on its
boundary CR (0); moreover |g(w)| ≤ 1/R on the circle |w| = R in view of the fact
that | f (w)| ≤ 1 for all w in B1 (0). It follows from the maximum modulus principle
(Theorem 3.9.6) that |g(w)| ≤ 1/R for all |w| ≤ R, in particular |g(0)| ≤ 1/R and
|g(z)| ≤ 1/R. Letting R ↑ 1 we obtain |g(0)| ≤ 1 and |g(z)| ≤ 1. Recasting these in
terms of f , we obtain | f (0)| ≤ 1 and | f (z)| ≤ |z|. Since |z| < 1 was an arbitrary
point in the unit disk, (4.6.1) and (4.6.2) hold.
Now suppose that equality holds in (4.6.1) for some z = z0 = 0 or equality holds
in (4.6.2). Then g attains its maximum in the interior of B1 (0) and it must be equal
to a constant A by Theorem 3.9.6 Thus f (w) = Aw for all |w| < 1. Since there is a

z0 = 0 in B1 (0) such that | f (z0 )| = |z0 | or f (0) = 1, it follows that |A| = 1.

Möbius Transformations on the Unit Disk
Maps of the form az+b
cz+d are called linear fractional transformations. We would
like to study a class of linear fractional transformations from the open unit disk to
itself of the form
z−a
,
|z| ≤ 1
(4.6.4)
φα (z) =
1−az
where a is a complex number with |a| < 1. As the denominator in (4.6.4) never
vanishes when |z| < 1, we note that these maps are analytic on the unit disk. A map
φa is called a Möbius transformation after the mathematician August Ferdinand
Möbius (1790–1868).
Proposition 4.6.2. (Properties of Möbius Transformations) Let a, b be complex
numbers with |a|, |b| < 1. Then for all |z| < 1 we have
(i) φa (0) = −a and φa (a) = 0.
(ii) φa is a one-to-one and onto map from B1 (0) to B1 (0).
(ii) φa is a one-to-one and onto map from C1 (0) to C1 (0).
(iv) φa−1 = φ−a .

1+ab
φ a+b (z) =

1 + a b 1+a b
1 + a b φ−b (a)

Proof. Assertion (i) is trivial. To prove (ii) and (iii) notice that for θ real we have


 iθ
 e − a   1 − ae−iθ 
iθ


 = 1.

=
|φa (e )| = 
1 − aeiθ   1 − aeiθ 
This shows that φa maps C1 (0) to C1 (0). It follows that φa maps B1 (0) to B1 (0),
otherwise it would achieve its maximum in the interior of B1 (0), contradicting the
maximum modulus principle (Theorem 3.9.6).
z−a
z −a
To prove the one-to-one assertion in (ii) and (iii) we assume 1−a
z = 1−a z and
we show that z = z . Cross-multiplying gives (z − a)(1 − az ) = (z − a)(1 − z)
which implies z − a − a z z + |a|2 z = z − a − a z z + |a|2 z. This in turn implies
z − z = |a|2 (z − z ), hence (z − z )(1 − |a|2 ) = 0, and so z = z .
z−a
= w in
We prove the onto assertion in (ii) and (iii) by solving the equation 1−az
z for a given w in the unit disk or on the unit circle. Indeed, algebraic manipulations
yield
w+a
= φ−a (w)
z=
1 + aw

288

4 Series of Analytic Functions and Singularities

and this z satisfies |z| < 1 if |w| < 1 and |z| = 1 if |w| = 1. This also proves (iv).
To prove (v) we use the quotient rule to write

φa (z) =

(1 − a z) − (z − a)(−a)



Let us examine how the properties of φa interplay with the maximum and minimum modulus principles. Clearly, φa is not constant, but we showed that |φa (z)|
equals 1 on C1 (0). Studying Corollary 3.9.10, we conclude that φa (z) must vanish
somewhere inside the unit disk. This is certainly the case since φa (a) = 0, and in
fact z = a is the only zero of φa (z) inside the unit disk.

The Schwarz-Pick theorem
Let f be a map defined on the unit disk B0 (1) that satisfies | f (z)| ≤ 1 for all |z| < 1.
We cannot directly apply Schwarz’s Lemma on f since we may not have f (0) = 0.
But we can compose f with two linear fractional transformations to achieve this.
Theorem 4.6.3. (Schwarz-Pick Theorem) Let f be an analytic function that maps
the open unit disk B1 (0) to the closed unit disk B1 (0). Then for a number a in the
disk B1 (0) we have


 f (z) − f (a)   z − a 

and also
| f (a)| ≤

.
1 − |a|2

(4.6.6)

Moreover, if equality holds in (4.6.5) for some z = a or equality holds in (4.6.6),
then f is equal to a unimodular constant times a Möbius transformation.

4.6 Schwarz’s Lemma

289

Proof. Let be f as in the statement of the theorem. Set b = f (a) and consider the
function
F = φb ◦ f ◦ φ−a
defined on the unit disk B1 (0); see Figure 4.19. Then F maps B1 (0) to B1 (0) and
we have
F(0) = φb ◦ f ◦ φ−a (0) = φb ( f (a)) = 0 ,
and moreover |F(z)| ≤ 1 for all |z| < 1. It follows from Lemma 4.6.1 that
|F(w)| = |φb ◦ f ◦ φ−a (w)| ≤ |w|,
so letting φ−a (w) = z and φa (z) = w we get |φb ◦ f (z)| ≤ |φa (z)| for z ∈ B1 (0). Using
the definition of φb we deduce (4.6.5).

Fig. 4.19 The function F = φb ◦ f ◦ φ−a .

Now consider F (0) = (φb ◦ f ◦ φ−a ) (0). Applying the chain rule, we write
F (0) = φb ( f (φ−a (0)) f (φ−a (0))φ−a (0).
Since φ−a (0) = 1 − |a|2 and φ−a (0) = a we obtain
(φb ◦ f ◦ φ−a ) (0) =

1 − |b|2
1 − |a|2
f (a)(1 − |a|2 ) = f (a)
.

(1 − |b| )
1 − |b|2

By Lemma 4.6.1 this number should have modulus at most 1, thus we obtain (4.6.6).
Suppose now that equality holds in (4.6.5) for some z = a or that equality holds
in (4.6.6). Then by Lemma 4.6.1 we must have φb ◦ f ◦ φ−a (z) = cz for |c| = 1,
so then f ◦ φ−a (z) = φ−b (cz) and leting φ−a (z) = w, we see f (w) = φ−b (cφa (w)).
Using Proposition 4.6.2 we write
ac
f (w) = φ−b (cφa (w)) = c φ−b c (φa (w)) = c 1−b

with

q = −φa (b c) ,

(note |d| = 1, |q| < 1),

thus f must be a Möbius transformation times a unimodular constant.

(a) If f fixes a point a in the unit disk, i.e., f (a) = a, show that | f (a)| ≤ 1.

Residue Theory
After having thought about this subject, and brought together
the diverse results mentioned above, I had the hope of establishing on a direct and rigorous analysis the passage from the real
to the imaginary; and my research has lead me to this Memoire.
-Augustin-Louis Cauchy (1789–1857)
[Writing about his Memoire of 1814, which contained the
residue theorem and several computations of real integrals by
complex methods.]
In previous chapters, we introduced complex functions and studied properties of
three essential tools: derivatives, integrals, and series of complex functions. In this
chapter, we derive some exciting applications of complex analysis based on one formula, known as Cauchy’s residue theorem. We have indirectly used this result when
computing integrals in previous sections. Here we highlight the main ideas behind
it and devise new techniques for computing Laplace transforms and integrals that
 ∞ sin x
∞
−x2 dx
arise in Fourier series. For instance, integrals like −∞
x dx and 0 (cos x)e
are often tedious to compute via real-variable techniques. With the residue theorem
and some additional estimates with complex functions, the computations of these
integrals become straightforward tasks.
In Section 5.7, we use residues to expand our knowledge of analytic functions.
We use integrals to count the number of zeros of analytic functions and give a formula for the inverse of analytic functions. Theoretical results, such as the open mapping property, are derived and used to obtain a fresh and different perspective on
concrete results such as the maximum modulus principle.
The residue theorem was discovered by Cauchy around 1814 but was explicitly
stated in 1831. Cauchy’s goal was to place under one umbrella the computations of
certain special integrals, some of which involving complex substitutions, that were
calculated by Euler, Laplace, Legendre, and others.

5.1 Cauchy’s Residue Theorem
Suppose that f is an analytic function on a deleted neighborhood of a point z0 and
has an isolated singularity at z0 . We know from Theorem 4.4.1, that f has a Laurent
series in an annulus around z0 : for 0 < |z − z0 | < R,
f (z) = · · · +

Furthermore, the series can be integrated term by term over any path that lies in the
annulus 0 < |z − z0 | < R. Let Cr (z0 ) be a positively oriented circle that lies in 0 <
|z − z0 | < R. If we integrate the Laurent series term by term over Cr (z0 ) and use the

fact that Cr (z0 ) (z − z0 )n dz = 0 if n = −1 and Cr (z0 ) z−z

Definition 5.1.1. The coefficient a−1 in (5.1.1) is called the residue of f at z0 and
is denoted by Res ( f , z0 ) or simply Res (z0 ) when there is no risk of confusion.
With the concept of residue in hand, we state our main result of this section which
reduces the evaluation of certain integrals to computations of residues.
Theorem 5.1.2. (Cauchy’s Residue Theorem) Let C be a simple closed positively
oriented path. Suppose that f is analytic inside and on C, except at finitely many
isolated singularities z1 , z2 , . . . , zn inside C. Then

We have z4 − 1 = (z − 1)(z + 1)(z − i)(z + i),
so ±1 and ±i are simple roots of the polynomial z4 − 1 = 0. Hence f (z) = z41−1 has simple
poles at ±1 and ±i by Theorem 4.5.15(ii). Let
z0 denote any one of the points 1, ±i. Because

Example 5.1.5 reminds us of the following simple observation: If z0 is a removable singularity, then Res ( f , z0 ) = 0.
For poles of higher order the situation is more complicated.
Theorem 5.1.6. Suppose that z0 is a pole of order m ≥ 1 of f . Then we have

where as usual the derivative of order 0 of a function is the function itself.
Notice that formula (5.1.6) reduces to (5.1.3) when m = 1.
Proof. By the Laurent series characterization of poles (Theorem 4.5.15),
f (z) =

(a) Compute the residues of f (z) = (z2 +πz2 )2 sin z at all isolated singularities inside C.

answering this question.

Step 1: Determine the singularities of f

inside C. The function f (z) = (z2 +πz2 )2 sin z is

analytic except where z2 + π 2 = 0 or sin z =
0. Thus f has isolated singularities at ±iπ
and at kπ where k is an integer. Only 0 and
iπ are inside C.
Step 2: Determine the type of the singularities of f inside C. Let us start with the singularity at 0. Using limz→0 sinz z = 1, it follows
that limz→0 sinz z = 1, and so

Step 3: Determine the residues of f inside C. At 0, f has a removable singularity, so
a−1 = 0, and hence the residue of f at 0 is 0. At iπ , we apply Theorem 5.1.6, with

So far the examples that we treated involved residues at poles of finite order.
There is no formula like (5.1.6) for computing the residue at an essential singularity.
We have to rely on various tricks to evaluate the coefficient a−1 in the Laurent series
expansion. We illustrate with several examples, starting with a useful observation.
Proposition 5.1.9. Suppose that 0 is an isolated singularity of an even function f
that is analytic on C \ {0}. Then Res ( f , 0) = 0.
Proof. We have to show that the a−1 the Laurent series coefficient of f at 0 is 0.
n
Write f (z) = ∑∞
n=−∞ an z , where 0 < |z| < r. Substitue −z for z and use the fact that
∞
n
n
n
f is even, i.e., f (−z) = f (z) for all z. Then ∑∞
n=−∞ an z = ∑n=−∞ (−1) an z , and by
n
the uniqueness of the Laurent series, it follows that (−1) an = an , which implies

that an = 0 if |n| is odd; in particular, a−1 = 0.

The preceding examples dealt with integrals over the interval [0, 2π ]. Integrals
over the interval [0, π ] can be handled if the integrand is even and 2π -periodic.

The integral −∞ f (x) dx of a continuous function f on the real line is also
improper since the interval of integration is infinite, but here it is infinite in both

Solution. To highlight the main ideas, we present the solution in basic steps.
Step 1: Show that the improper integral is convergent. Because the integrand is continuous on the real line, it is enough to show that the integral outside a finite interval,

2

say [−1, 1], is convergent. For |x| ≥ 1, we have x4x+1 ≤ xx4 = x12 , and since 1∞ x12 dx

(5.3.4)

Step 2: Set up the contour integral. We replace x by z and consider the function
2
f (z) = z4z+1 . The general guideline is to integrate this function over a contour that
consists partly of the interval [−R, R], so as to recapture the integral
part of the contour integral on γR .
Choosing the appropriate contour is
not obvious in general. For a ratio2
nal function, such as x4x+1 , where the
denominator does not vanish on the
x-axis and the degree of the denominator is larger than the degree of the
numerator by 2, a closed semicircle γR
as in Figure 5.15 will work. Since γR
consists of the interval [−R, R] followed
by the semicircle σR , using the additive property of path integrals [Proposition 3.2.12(i)], we write
IγR =



f (z) dz =

f (z) dz = IR + IσR .
x2
x4 +1

(5.3.5)

and dz = dx, and so IR =

dx, which according to (5.3.4) converges to the desired integral as R → ∞.
So, in order to compute the desired integral, we must get a handle on the other quantities, IγR and IσR , in (5.3.5). Our strategy is as follows: In Step 3, we compute IγR by
the residue theorem; and in Step 4, we show that limR→∞ IσR = 0. These provide the
necessary ingredients to complete the solution in Step 5.

5.3 Improper Integrals Involving Rational and Exponential Functions

Step 3: Compute IγR by the residue theorem. For R > 1, the function f (z) = z4z+1
has two poles inside γR . These are the roots of z4 + 1 = 0 in the upper half-plane. To
solve z4 = −1, we write −1 = eiπ ; then using the formula for the nth roots (Proposition 1.3.10), we find the four roots

5 Residue Theory

In Example 5.3.3, we could have used
the contour γR in the lower half-plane as
shown in Figure 5.16. In this case, it is
easier to take the orientation of γR to be
negative in order to coincide with the orientation of the interval [−R, R]. A calculation similar to that in Example 5.3.3
using the path γR instead of γR yields the
same answer.
Fig. 5.16 An alternative path.

The idea used in the solution of Example 5.3.3 can be used to prove the following
general result.
Proposition 5.3.4. Let p, q be polynomials of a real variable and assume that q has
no real roots; assume furthermore that
degree q ≥ 2 + degree p.
Let σR denote the arc {Reiθ : 0 ≤ θ ≤ π }. Then we have

and q(x) = bm xm + · · · + b1 x + b0 , where an = 0 = bm and m ≥ n + 2, then when
z = Reiθ , for R sufficiently large, we have

as R → ∞, since m > n + 1. This proves (5.3.7). All the poles of p(x)/q(x) are inside
the interior of the contour σR ∪ [−R, R] for large R and consequently, identity (5.3.8)
follows from Theorem 5.1.2.

Solution. The integrand satisfies the two conditions of Proposition 5.3.4:
degree q = 4 ≥ 2 + degree p = 2
and the denominator q(x) = (x2 + 1)(x2 + 4) has no real roots. So we may apply
(5.3.8). We have
(z2 + 1)(z2 + 4) = (z + i)(z − i)(z + 2i)(z − 2i),
and hence the function
1
(z2 + 1)(z2 + 4)
has simple poles at i and 2i in the upper halfplane (Figure 5.17). The residues there are

Integrals Involving Exponential Functions
The success of the method of contour integration crucially depends on the choice of
contours. In the previous examples, we used expanding semicircular contours. To
evaluate integrals involving exponential functions, we use rectangular contours. We
consider integrals of the form
 ∞

eax
dx,
bx
−∞ e + c

where 0 < a < b, c > 0.

314

5 Residue Theory

Since c > 0 and ebx > 0, the denominator does not vanish. Also the condition a < b
guarantees that the integral is convergent near +∞, while the integrand is bounded
by eax /c, hence it is integrable near −∞ as well.

the identity
 +∞

π
dx =

π .
αx + 1

Solution Step 1: As noted before, since α > 1, the integral converges. The integrand
z
leads us to define the analytic function f (z) = eαez +1 , whose poles are the roots of
eα z + 1 = 0. Since the exponential function is 2π i-periodic, then
eα z = −1 = eiπ

⇔

α z = iπ + 2kπ i

⇔

z

Thus f (z) = eαez +1 has infinitely many poles
(Figure 5.18).
Step 2: Select the contour of integration. Our contour should expand in the
x-direction in order to cover the entire xaxis. To avoid including infinitely many
poles on the y-axis, we do not expand
the contour in the upper half-plane, as
we did with the semicircles in the previous examples. Instead, we use a rectangular contour γR consisting of the paths
γ1 , γ2 , γ3 , and γ4 , as in Figure 5.18, and
let I j denote the path integral of f over
γ j ( j = 1, . . . , 4). As R → ∞, γR will
expand in the horizontal direction, but
the length of the vertical sides remains
fixed at 2απ .

This last equality explains the choice of the vertical sides: They are chosen so that
the integral on the returning horizontal side γ3 is equal to a constant multiple of the
integral on γ1 . From here the solution is straightforward.
Step 3: Apply the residue theorem. From Step 2, we have only one pole of f inside
γR at z0 = απ i. Since eα z + 1 has a simple root, this is a simple pole. Using Proposition 5.1.3(ii), we find

semicircular contours as in Example 5.3.3. One such integral is

(5.3.13)

This integral can be reduced to an integral involving exponential functions, via the
substitution x = et . We outline this useful technique in the following example.

Solution. Step 1: Show that the integral converges. The integrand is continuous, so
it is enough to show that the integral converges on [1, ∞). We have xα1+1 ≤ x1α , and

the integral is convergent since 1∞ x1α dx < ∞.
Step 2: Apply the substitution x = et . Let x = et , dx = et dt, and note that as x varies
from 0 to ∞, t varies from −∞ to ∞, and so

This integral is improper as the interval of integration is infinite and the integrand tends to −∞ as x ↓ 0. To define
the convergence of such integrals, we
follow the general procedure of taking
all one-sided limits one at a time; see
Figure 5.19. Thus

where, for convenience, in the last integral we have used x as a variable of integration
instead of t. Identity (5.3.14) follows now from Example 5.3.6.

choosing the contour. Let us clarify

By observing

inequality eisz  ≤ 1 for all s ≥ 0 and
 z=
 Re , 0 ≤ θ ≤ π . A more precise analysis
of sin θ yields a better estimate on eisz , which in turn makes possible to compute
integrals of the form (5.4.1), where degree q ≥ 1 + degree p.
Lemma 5.4.2. (Jordan’s Lemma) The following inequality is valid for R > 0:
 π

At this point, we need an estimate on sin θ .
On the interval [0, π2 ], the graph of sin θ is
concave down, because the second derivative is negative. Hence the graph of sin θ for
0 ≤ θ ≤ π2 is above the chordal line that joins
two points on the graph. In particular, it is
above the chord that joins the origin to the
point ( π2 , 1), whose equation is y = π2 θ .

Lemma 5.4.3. (General Version of Jordan’s Lemma) Let R0 > 0 and 0 ≤ θ1 <
θ2 ≤ π . For R ≥ R0 , let σR be the circular arc of all z = Reiθ with 0 ≤ θ1 ≤ θ ≤
θ2 ≤ π as shown in Figure 5.23. Let f be a continuous complex-valued function

An analog of Jordan’s lemma holds for s < 0 if the circular arc σR is in the lower
half-plane. Applying Jordan’s lemma in the special case when f (z) is a rational
function, we obtain the following useful result.

324

5 Residue Theory

Corollary 5.4.4. Let p, q are complex polynomials with degree q ≥ 1 + degree p. Let
σR denote the semicircular arc consisting of all z = Reiθ , where 0 ≤ θ ≤ π . Then

p(z)
dz = 0 for all s > 0.
limR→∞ σR eisz q(z)
Proof. Let M(R) denote the maximum of |p(z)/q(z)| for z on σR . Since degree q
≥ 1 + degree p, M(R) → 0 as R → ∞. Applying Lemma 5.4.3 we obtain the claimed
assertion.

Next we evaluate the improper integral

x2 + a2

dx.

It is not difficult to show that this integral is convergent using integration by parts
(Exercise 19). However, because the degree of x2 + a2 is only one more than the
degree of x, the estimate in Step 3 of Example 5.4.1 will not be sufficient to show
that the integral on the expanding semicircle tends to 0. For this purpose we appeal
to Jordan’s lemma.

This identity is in fact needed in many applications. In the remainder of this section,
we develop a method to calculate similar and other interesting integrals.
In Section 5.3 we defined the Cauchy principal value of an improper integral over
the real line. However, an integral can also be improper if the integrand becomes
unbounded at a point inside the interval of integration. To make our discussion concrete, consider

Now, we return to the integral −∞
x dx. Since the integrand is well-behaved
at x = 0 and the integral over the infinite interval converges, we can compute it by
 ∞ eix
taking the imaginary part of P.V. −∞
x dx.

This principal value integral involves
the limit as r → 0+ and R → ∞ of
an integral over [−R, −r] and [r, R].
We envision this as a contour inteiz
gral of the complex function ez and
close the contour with a large positively
oriented semicircle of radius R and a
small negatively oriented semicircle of
radius r, which bypasses the problem at
0. The resulting path γr,R is shown in
Figure 5.28. The limit of the path integral over the small circle will be computed using the following result.

Lemma 5.4.7. (Shrinking Path Lemma) Suppose that f is a continuous complexvalued function on a closed disk Br0 (z0 ) with center at z0 and radius r0 . For 0 <
r ≤ r0 , let σr denote the positively oriented circular arc at angle α (Figure 5.29),
consisting of all z = z0 +reiθ , where θ0 ≤ θ ≤ θ0 + α , θ0 and α are fixed, and α = 0.

Since f is continuous on Br0 (z0 ), it follows that Fig. 5.29 Circular arc of angle α .
it is uniformly continuous on this set. Thus given
ε > 0 there is δ > 0 such that |w − w | < δ
implies | f (w) − f (w )| < ε . 

Then |r − r | < δ implies (z0 + reiθ ) − (z0 + r eiθ ) < δ which in turn implies
| f (z0 + reiθ ) − f (z0 + r eiθ )| < ε . The ML-inequality yields

which is equivalent to (5.4.20).
The following simple consequence of Lemma 5.4.7 is useful.

Corollary 5.4.8. Suppose that g is an analytic function in a deleted neighborhood
of z0 with a simple pole at z0 . For 0 < r ≤ r0 , let σr be the circular arc at angle α
(see Figure 5.29). Then we have


lim

r→0+

σr


g(z) dz = iα Res g, z0 .

(5.4.21)

Proof. Let f (z) = (z − z0 )g(z) for z = z0 and define f (z0 ) = limz→z0 (z − z0 )g(z) =
Res (g, z0 ). Since g has a simple pole at z0 , it follows from Theorem 4.5.15 that f
is analytic at z0 . Now apply Lemma 5.4.7 to f and (5.4.21) follows from (5.4.20),

since for z = z0 , f (z)/(z − z0 ) = g(z).
The improper integrals that we consider next differ from previous ones in that
they are not always convergent; however, their Cauchy principal values do exist.

The choice of this branch is usually
affected by the choice of the contour
of integration. In this case, we use the
contour γ in Figure 5.34, and choose a
branch of zα = eα log z that equals the realnumbered power xα on the x-axis and is
analytic on the contour. There are several possibilities, but clearly the easiest
one is zα = eα Log z where Log z denotes
the principal value branch of the logarithm, with a branch cut on the negative x-axis. Recall that for z = 0, Log z =
ln |z| + i Arg z, where −π < Arg z ≤ π .

In our next example, we illustrate an important method that is based on the fact
that different branches of the logarithm differ by an integer multiple of 2π i. We note
that the example can also be evaluated using the substitution x = et , as in Section 5.3.

On Γ1 , we can take the principal branch of zα , which coincides with the real
power on the real axis and allows us to recover the integral (5.5.8). We cannot use
the residue theorem to help integrate this one branch all the way around the origin,
because of its branch cut on the negative real axis. Thus we have closed Γ1 , bringing
it back at the ray θ = 34π , and use a different branch of zα to integrate on Γ2 . For
α log π z

2 . In the second quadrant, this
the integral on Γ2 , we choose the branch zα = e
branch coincides with the principal branch (and so integrals over γ5 and γ6 cancel),
but the new branch continues to be analytic as we wind around the origin into the
third and fourth quadrants. It is important to note that integrals over γ1 and γ2 will
not cancel because the two branches of zα are not the same here; the logarithm
branches differ by 2π i. With this in mind, let

f1 (z) =

eα Log z (z + 1)

and

f2 (z) =

We integrate f1 on Γ1 and f2 on Γ2 . Let I j denote the integral of the

(5.5.9)

For z on γ5 (and hence γ6 ) we have Log z = log π z, hence f1 (z) = f2 (z), and conse2
quently I5 = −I6 ; thus it follows
I5 + I6 = 0.

(5.5.10)

From here on the details of the solution are very much like the previous example.
The function f1 is analytic on and inside Γ1 , so by Cauchy’s theorem

Γ1

f1 (z) dz = I1 + I3 + I5 + I7 = 0.

as desired. So let us show that I3 , I4 , I7 , I8 tend to 0. This part is similar to Exam1
ple 5.5.2; we just sketch the details. We have |zα | = |z|α , so | f j (z)| ≤ |z|α |1−|z||
( j = 1, 2). For z on γ7 or γ8 , |z| = r (we may take r < 1), and so

as R → ∞,

because the degree of the numerator, 1 − α , is smaller than the degree of the denom
inator, which is 1. Similarly, |I4 | → 0 as R → ∞.
In Example 5.5.3, the point of introducing different branches of the multiple1
valued function zα (z+1)
was to explicitly indicate how the function can continuously
change as we wind around the origin, and how its value on the real axis is affected
by the winding. Now we illustrate a useful idea that can be used as an alternative
to multiple branches. The idea is to think of a function as taking different values at
a point on the branch cut depending on how we approach this point. Consider, for
example,
√
(a real),
(5.5.14)
h(z) = z − a
where we use the log0 branch of the square root, so that the branch cut of h(z) is
1 i
on the part of the positive x-axis x > a. Explicitly, h(z) = |z − a| 2 e 2 arg0 (z−a) , where
0 < arg0 (z − a) ≤ 2π . We will use this function and allow it to take different values
on the branch cut, depending on how we approach the branch cut. For example, if
z approaches the part x > a of the x-axis from the upper half-plane (Figure 5.39),
then arg0 (z − a) approaches
√ h to the right of a
√ 0 and so the valuesof the function
and above the x-axis are z − a which tend to |x − a| = x − a. If z approaches
the part x > a of the x-axis from the lower half-plane (Figure 5.40), then arg0 (z − a)

In our final example
 we prove a useful property of elliptic integrals, which are
integrals of the form √dx , where p is a polynomial of degree ≥ 2. These integrals
p(x)

arise when computing arc length of ellipses, and thus their name. They also arise
when computing Schwarz-Christoffel transformations.

Solution. Consider the function

√
z−a z−b z−c

where we choose the branches of the square roots with branch cuts along the positive
real axis. The function f is analytic at all z except possibly at z = x ≥ a (in fact, the
singularities are removable along b < z < c, see Exercise 23). Since f is analytic
inside and on the contour in Figure 5.42, Cauchy’s theorem implies that its integral
on this contour is 0. Letting I j denote the integral of the limiting values of f on γ j ,
we obtain
I1 + I2 + I3 + I4 + I5 + I6 + I7 + I8 + I9 + I10 + I11 + I12 = 0.

zα (z+1) . Use the contour in Figure 5.54, and treat this function to have different values on the

z−a z−b z−c
(a) Use Figure 5.43 to show that the limits of f (z) as z approaches the interval (b, c) from the upper
half-plane and from the lower half-plane are the same.
(b) Define f (z) on (b, c) to be this common value. To show that f is analytic here, use Morera’s theorem. [Hint: If a triangle crosses the real axis, subdivide it into a triangle and a quadrilateral, each
with one side on the real axis. Approximate these by triangles and quadrilaterals that lie entirely in
the upper or the lower half-plane over which the corresponding integrals vanish.]
(c) Rederive (5.5.15) using Figure 5.55 and the fact that the paths γ1 and γ2 are homotopic.

5.6 Summing Series by Residues

Proof. To prove (5.6.2), we deal with each side of the square ΓN separately. On
the right vertical side, z = N + 12 + iy, where −N − 12 ≤ y ≤ N + 12 . Using formulas
(1.7.18) and (1.7.19) we obtain

This establishes (5.6.2) for z on the right vertical side of ΓN . For z on left vertical side
the estimate follows immediately, since cot(π z) is an odd function. The horizontal
sides are handled similarly (Exercise 19). To prove (5.6.3), we use the inequality
for path integrals, Theorem 3.2.19, the fact that the perimeter of the square ΓN is
4(2N + 1), and (5.6.2) and obtain

5.7 The Counting Theorem and Rouché’s Theorem
In this section, we derive several properties of analytic functions. We start with a
simple but useful lemma.
Lemma 5.7.1. Suppose that f is analytic and not identically zero in a region Ω .
 (z)
(i) If z0 is a zero of f of order m ≥ 1, then ff (z)

(ii) If z0 is a pole of f of order m ≥ 1, then ff (z)
residue there is −m.
Proof. (i) Write f (z) = (z − z0 )m λ (z), where λ is analytic and nonvanishing in a
neighborhood Br (z0 ), as in Theorem 4.5.2. For z in Br (z0 ),



that z0 is a simple pole of ff and the residue there is m.
(ii) Write f (z) = (z − z0 )−m λ (z), where λ is analytic and nonvanishing in a neighborhood Br (z0 ) (Theorem 4.5.15(ii)). Then for z in Br (z0 ),

The next result bears the name the counting theorem because it counts the number of zeros (according to multiplicity) of an analytic function inside a simple path.
Counting zeros according to multiplicity means that each zero is counted as many
times as its order.

p(z) = (z − 1)(z − i)2 (z + 2i)

Theorem 5.7.2. (Counting Theorem) Suppose that C is a simple closed positively

Proof. If f has no zeros in Ω (hence N( f ) = 0), then ff is analytic on Ω and
(5.7.3) follows from Cauchy’s theorem. Note that f cannot have infinitely many
zeros in Ω , by Corollary 4.5.7. Let z1 , z2 , . . . , zn denote the zeros of f inside Ω . By

Lemma 5.7.1, ff has simple poles in Ω located at z j and the residue at z j is the order

of the zero at z j . Thus (5.7.3) follows at once from the residue theorem.

5 Residue Theory

A function is called meromorphic on a region if it is analytic in this region
z
except at its poles. For example, zsin
2 +1 is meromorphic in the complex plane. Like
zeros, we will count poles according to multiplicity. Next we generalize Theorem 5.7.2 to meromorphic functions.
Theorem 5.7.3. (Meromorphic Counting Theorem) Suppose that C is a simple
closed positively oriented path, Ω is the region inside C, and f is meromorphic on
Ω and analytic and nonvanishing on C. Let N( f ) denote the number of zeros of f
inside Ω and P( f ) denote the number of poles of f inside Ω , counted according to
multiplicity. Then N( f ) and P( f ) are finite and
N( f ) − P( f ) =

C

f  (z)

f (z)

(5.7.4)

Proof. That N( f ) and P( f ) are finite follows as in the proof of Theorem 5.7.2.
Applying Theorem 5.1.2 and using Lemma 5.7.1 we see that (5.7.4) holds.

Either of the preceding theorems is also known as the argument principle
because the right sides of (5.7.3) and (5.7.4) can be interpreted as the change in
argument as one runs around the image path f [C]. We now investigate this.
Proposition 5.7.4. (Branch of the Logarithm) If f is analytic and nonvanishing on
a simply connected region Ω , then there exists an analytic branch of the logarithm,
log f = ln | f | + i arg f , such that for all z in Ω we have
d
f  (z)
log f (z) =
.
dz
f (z)

(5.7.5)

Proof. We know from Corollary 3.6.9(ii) that every analytic function on a simply
connected region Ω has an antiderivative. In particular, if f is analytic and nonvanishing on Ω , then f  / f is analytic on Ω and thus has an antiderivative on Ω . We
call this antiderivative a branch of the logarithm of f and write it as log f . Indeed,
the branch of the logarithm is of the form
log f = ln | f | + i arg f ,
where arg f is a continuous branch of the argument. Then
elog f = f
which implies (5.7.5).

hence

(log f ) elog f = f  ,


The integrand in (5.7.4) suggests a connection with the logarithm of f , which
we now explore. Let f and C be as in Theorem 5.7.3. Since f [C] is a closed and

5.7 The Counting Theorem and Rouché’s Theorem

bounded set that does not contain the origin, we can partition C into small subarcs
γ j ( j = 1, . . . , n) such that each image f [γ j ] is contained in a simply connected region
that does not contain the origin, as shown in Figure 5.58.

Fig. 5.58 The image f [γ1 ] is contained in a simply connected region not containing the origin. We can define the branch arg1 z on this region.

Denote the initial and terminal points of γ j by z j−1 and z j , with zn = z0 . For each
j = 1, . . . , n, we have a branch of the logarithm of f , log j f , which is an antiderivative


of ff on γ j . For each j, we have log j f = ln | f | + i arg j f , where arg j is a branch of
the argument, determined up to an additive constant multiple of 2π . These constants
are determined in the following way. Starting with j = 1, pick and fix arg1 f . Then
choose arg2 f in such a way that arg1 f (z1 ) = arg2 f (z1 ). Continue in this manner to
determine the remaining branches of the argument. To simplify the notation, denote
the resulting function by arg f . Note that
arg f is continuous on C, except at
z0 = zn , and we will make the conf C
vention that arg f takes different valf z
ues at this point depending on whether
we approach the point from γ1 or
from γn . Thus arg f (zn ) = argn f (zn ) and
arg f (z0 ) = arg1 f (z0 ), and the difference
is always an integer multiple of 2π that
we denote by ΔC arg f = argn f (zn ) −
arg1 f (z0 ). The quantity ΔC arg f meaFig. 5.59 The point f (z) travels

We evaluate the integral on the right side of (5.7.3) or (5.7.4) with a telescoping
sum:

(5.7.6)

This formula links two somewhat unrelated quantities: the net change in the argument of f as we travel once around C, and the number of zeros and poles of f inside
C. The formula has many interesting applications, as we now illustrate.
Example 5.7.5. (The argument principle) Find the number of zeros of the polynomial z6 + 6z + 10 in the first quadrant.
Solution. We apply the argument principle, which in this case is expressed by
1
2π ΔC arg f = N( f ) since polynomials have no poles. The contour C is a closed quarter circle of radius R > 0, as shown in Figure 5.60.

Fig. 5.61 The path f [C] (pictured for R = 2) goes around
the origin once.

Since the given polynomial has finitely many zeros (at most six), if R is large
enough, the contour C will contain all the zeros in the first quadrant. Our goal is
to determine the change of the argument of z6 + 6z + 10 as z runs through C. We
proceed in steps.
Step 1: Show that there are no roots on the contour C. We can always choose R > 0
so that no roots lie on the circular arc γR . We need to prove that there are no roots on
the nonnegative x-axis and y-axis. If z = x ≥ 0, then f (z) = x6 + 6x + 10, and this is

5.7 The Counting Theorem and Rouché’s Theorem

355

clearly positive. If z = iy, with y ≥ 0, then f (iy) = (iy)6 +6iy+10 = (−y6 +10)+6iy
and because Im( f (iy)) = 0 ⇔ y = 0 ⇒ Re ( f (iy)) = 0, we see that f (iy) = 0.
Step 2: Compute the change of the argument of f (z) as z varies from the initial to
the terminal point of I1 = [0, R]. For z = 0, f (z) = 10, and for 0 ≤ z = x ≤ R, f (z) =
x6 + 6x + 10 > 0. So the image of the interval [0, R] is the interval [10, R6 + 6R + 10]
and the argument of f (z) does not change on I1 .
Step 3: Compute the change of the argument of f (z) as z varies from the initial to
the terminal point of the arc γR . Here we are not looking for the exact image of γR
by f , but only a rough picture that gives us the change in the argument of f . For
very large R and z on γR , write z = Reiθ , where 0 ≤ θ ≤ π2 . Then

f (z) = R6 e6iθ 1 + 5 e−i5θ + 6 e−6iθ ≈ R6 e6iθ ,
R
R
because R65 e−i5θ + R106 e−6iθ ≈ 0. So as θ varies from 0 to π2 , the argument of f (Reiθ )
varies from 0 to 6 · π2 = 3π . In fact, the point f (iR) = −R6 + 10 + 6iR lies in the
second quadrant and has argument very close to 3π . See Figure 5.61.
Step 4: Compute the change of the argument of f (z) as z varies from iR to 0. As
z varies from iR to 0, f (z) varies from w3 = −R6 + 10 + 6iR to w0 = 10. Since
Im f (z) ≥ 0, this tells us that the point f (z) remains in the upper half-plane as f (z)
moves from w3 to w0 . Hence the change in the argument of f (z) is −π .
Step 5: Apply the argument principle. The net change of the argument of f (z) as
we travel once around C is 3π − π = 2π . According to (5.7.6), the number of zeros

of f inside C, and hence in the first quadrant, is 21π 2π = 1.
We give one more version of the counting theorem.
Theorem 5.7.6. (Variant of the Counting Theorem) Let C, Ω , and f be as in
Theorem 5.7.3, let g be analytic on an open set that contains C and its interior. Let
z1 , z2 , . . . , zn1 denote the zeros of f in Ω and p1 , p2 , . . . , pn2 denote the poles of f
in Ω . Let m(z j ) be the order of the root z j of f and m(p j ) denote the order of the
pole p j of f . Then

this zero is simple. Also, using the 2π i-periodicity of ez , it is easy to see that ez = 1

As an application of the counting principle we derive a famous result known
as Rouché’s theorem, named after the French mathematician and educator Eugène
Rouché (1832–1910). We need the following lemma.
Lemma 5.7.8. Let φ be a continuous function on a region Ω that takes only integer
values. Then φ is constant in Ω .
Proof. Assume that φ is not constant, and let z1 and z2 in Ω be such that φ (z1 ) =
n1 < φ (z2 ) = n2 . Let r be a real number such that n1 < r < n2 . Since φ is continuous,
the sets
A = {z ∈ Ω : φ (z) < r}
B = {z ∈ Ω : φ (z) > r}
are open. Also, z1 ∈ A and z2 ∈ B, hence A and B are nonemtpy. They are also
disjoint and satisfy A ∪ B = Ω . This contradicts the fact that Ω is connected. Thus
φ is constant.

In what follows, we need a version of Lemma 5.7.8, where φ is a continuous,
integer-valued function on an interval [a, b]. The preceding proof can be easily modified to cover this case.
Theorem 5.7.9. (Rouché’s Theorem) Suppose that C is a simple closed path, Ω is
the region inside C, f and g are analytic inside and on C. If |g(z)| < | f (z)| for all z
on C, then
N( f + g) = N( f )
in other words, f + g and f have the same number of zeros on Ω .

5.7 The Counting Theorem and Rouché’s Theorem

357

Proof. For z on C, the inequality |g(z)| < | f (z)| implies that f (z) = 0, and so |g|/| f |
is continuous and strictly less than 1 on C. Since C is a closed and bounded set,
|g|/| f | attains its maximum δ < 1 on C. Pick δ < δ1 < 1. For z on C and 0 < |λ | ≤
1/δ1 , if f (z) + λ g(z) = 0, then |g(z)|/| f (z)| = 1/|λ | ≥ δ1 , which contradicts that
|g|/| f | ≤ δ on C. So f (z) + λ g(z) is not equal to zero for all z on C and |λ | ≤ 1/δ1 .
We claim that the function

φ (λ ) =

1
2π i


C

f  (z) + λ g (z)
dz
f (z) + λ g(z)

(5.7.8)

is continuous in λ on [−1/δ1 , 1/δ1 ]. To verify this, notice that the integrand G(λ , z)
in (5.7.8) is continuous and thus uniformly continuous on [0, 1/δ1 ] × C. Consequently, G(λ , z) is close to G(λ  , z) uniformly in z and thus the integral of G(λ , z)
in z is close to that of G(λ  , z) in z. By Theorem 5.7.2, φ (λ ) = N( f + λ g), and so
φ is integer-valued. By Lemma 5.7.8, φ is constant for all |λ | < 1/δ . In particular,
φ (0) = N( f ) = φ (1) = N( f + g).

We can give a geometric interpretation
of Rouché’s theorem, based on the argument principle. According to (5.7.6), we
are merely claiming that

ΔC arg( f + g) = ΔC arg f .

y
f z

(5.7.9)

As z traces C, f (z) winds around the
origin a specific number of times. Since
|g(z)| < | f (z)|, the point f (z) + g(z) must lie
in the disk of radius | f (z)| centered at f (z)
(Figure 5.62), and so f (z) + g(z) must wind
around the origin the same number of times
as f (z) (see Exercise 25).

gz

Fig. 5.62 Suppose that for each z
on C there is a rope, shorter than
the distance from f (z) to the origin, joining f (z) to f (z) + g(z).
Then f (z) + g(z) goes around the
origin the same number of times
as f (z) goes around the origin,
when z traces the curve C.

The following are typical applications of Rouché’s theorem.
Example 5.7.10. (Counting zeros with Rouché’s theorem)
(a) Show that all zeros of p(z) = z4 + 6z + 3 lie inside the circle |z| = 2.
(b) Show that if a is a real number with a > e, then in |z| < 1 the equation ez = azn
has n roots (counting orders).
Solution. (a) Since p is a polynomial of degree 4, it is enough to show that N(p) = 4
inside the circle |z| = 2. Take f (z) = z4 and g(z) = 6z + 3 and note that f (z) + g(z) =
p(z). For |z| = 2, we have | f (z)| = 24 = 32 and |g(z)| ≤ |6z|+3 = 15. Hence |g(z)| <
| f (z)| for all z on the circle |z| = 2, and so by Rouché’s theorem N( f ) = N( f + g) =
N(p). Clearly f has one zero with multiplicity 4 at z = 0. Thus N( f ) = 4 and so
N(p) = 4, as desired.

358

5 Residue Theory

(b) Take f (z) = azn and g(z) = −ez . Counted according to multiplicity, f has n zeros
in |z| < 1 and so N( f ) = n. For |z| = 1, | f (z)| = |azn | = a and


|g(z)| = |ez | = ecos θ +i sin θ  = ecos θ ≤ e < a.
Thus |g(z)| < | f (z)| for all |z| = 1 and so by Rouché’s theorem n = N(azn ) =

N(azn − ez ), which implies that azn − ez = 0 has n roots in |z| < 1.
As a further application we give a very simple proof of the fundamental theorem
of algebra.

Example 5.7.11. (The fundamental theorem of algebra) Let
p(z) = an zn + an−1 zn−1 + · · · + a1 z + a0
with an = 0 be a polynomial of degree n ≥ 1. Show that p has exactly n roots,
counting multiplicity.
Solution. Take f (z) = an zn . Then f has a zero of multiplicity n at z = 0. Also, for
|z| = R, we have | f (z)| = |an | Rn , which is a polynomial of degree n in R. Now let
g(z) = an−1 zn−1 + · · · + a1 z + a0 , then |g(z)| ≤ |an−1 | |zn−1 | + · · · + |a1 | |z| + |a0 |, and
so for |z| = R, |g(z)| ≤ |an−1 | Rn−1 +· · ·+|a1 | R+|a0 |. Since the modulus of f grows
at a faster rate than the modulus of g, in the sense that

1
|an−1 | Rn−1 + · · · + |a1 | R + |a0 | = 0,
n
R→∞ |an | R
lim

we can find R0 large enough so that for R ≥ R0 , we have
|an−1 | Rn−1 + · · · + |a1 | R + |a0 | < |an | Rn .
This implies that |g(z)| < | f (z)| for all |z| = R with R ≥ R0 . By Rouché’s theorem,
N( f ), the number of zeros of f in the region |z| < R, is the same as N( f + g), the
number of zeros of f + g. But N( f ) = n and f + g = p, so N(p) = n showing that p
has exactly n zeros.

The Local Mapping Theorem
In this part, we investigate fundamental properties of the inverse function of analytic functions When do they exist? Are they analytic? Are there explicit formulas
for them? All these questions can be answered with the help of Rouché’s theorem
and the counting theorem. Our investigation leads to interesting new properties of
analytic functions and shed new light on some classical results studied earlier. In
particular, we give a simple proof of the maximum modulus principle. Interesting
applications of these topics are presented in the exercises, including a formula due

5.7 The Counting Theorem and Rouché’s Theorem

359

to Lagrange for the inverse of analytic functions with some of its applications to the
solution to transcendental equations.
Suppose that f is analytic at z0 and let w0 = f (z0 ). We say that f has order m ≥ 1
at z0 if the zero of f (z) − w0 has order m at z0 . The order of f at z0 is the order of the
first nonvanishing term in the Taylor series expansion, past the constant term. Thus
f has order m at z0 if and only if f ( j) (z0 ) = 0 for j = 1, . . . , m − 1 and f (m) (z0 ) = 0.
In particular, f has order 1 at z0 if and only if f  (z0 ) = 0.
Theorem 5.7.12. (Local Mapping Theorem) Let f be a nonconstant analytic function in a neighborhood of z0 . Let w0 = f (z0 ) and n be the order of f at z0 . Then there
exist R > 0 and ρ > 0 such that for every w ∈ Bρ (w0 ) \ {w0 } there are precisely n
distinct points in BR (z0 ) whose image under f is w.
Proof. Since f − w0 has a zero of order n ≥ 1, write
f (z) − w0 = an (z − z0 )n + an+1 (z − z0 )n+1 + · · · ,
where an = 0. Then limz→z0

f (z)−w0
(z−z0 )n

= an = 0. So we can find R > 0 such that



 f (z) − w0  |an |


 (z − z0 )n  > 2 ,

for all 0 < |z − z0 | ≤ R.

(5.7.10)

In particular, for z = z0 we have f (z) = w0 , and for |z − z0 | = R we have
| f (z) − w0 | |an |
>
Rn
2

⇒

| f (z) − w0 | >

|an |Rn
.
2

(5.7.11)

By taking a smaller value of R if necessary, we can also assume that f  (z) = 0 for
n
all z = z0 with |z − z0 | < R. Now take ρ = |an2|R , then for |w0 − w| < ρ , set g(z) to
be the constant w0 − w. For |z − z0 | = R, using (5.7.11), we find
|g(z)| = |w0 − w| ≤

|an |Rn
< | f (z) − w0 |,
2

and so by Rouché’s theorem, N( f − w) = N( f − w0 + g) = N( f − w0 ), and since
N( f − w0 ) = n it follows that N( f − w) = n for all |w − w0 | < ρ . So w has n
antecedents in |z − z0 | < R. As f  (z) = 0 for all z satisfying 0 < |z − z0 | < R, we
do not have repeated roots, and so the antecedents are all distinct.

The case n = 1 of the theorem deserves a separate statement.
Theorem 5.7.13. (Inverse Function Theorem) Suppose that f is analytic on a
region Ω and z0 is in Ω . Then f is one-to-one on some neighborhood Br (z0 ) if
and only if f  (z0 ) = 0.
Proof. If f  (z0 ) = 0, f has order 1 and by Theorem 5.7.12 we can find R and ρ
such that for 0 < |w − w0 | < ρ , f takes on the value w exactly once in BR (z0 ).
Also, f takes on the value w0 only at z0 . Let U = f −1 [Bρ (w0 )] be the pre-image of

360

5 Residue Theory

Bρ (w0 ) under f . Since Bρ (w0 ) is open and f is continuous, U is open (Exercise 41,
Section 2.2) and it clearly contains z0 . So we can find an open disk Br (z0 ) that is
contained in U and BR (z0 ). Then f is one-to-one on Br (z0 ), for if f (z1 ) = f (z2 ) is a
point in Bρ (w0 ), Theorem 5.7.12 guarantees z1 = z2 . Conversely, if f  (z0 ) = 0, then
the order of f at z0 is at least 2. Applying Theorem 5.7.12 we find a neighborhood
of z0 on which f is at least two-to-one; so f is not one-to-one in this case.

A few comments are in order regarding the inverse function theorem. The theorem can be obtained from the classical inverse function theorem in two variables.
The latter states that the mapping (x, y) → (u(x, y), v(x, y)) is one-to-one in a neighborhood of (x0 , y0 ) if its Jacobian is nonzero at (x0 , y0 ); recall that the Jacobian of
this mapping at (x, y) is


 ux (x, y) uy (x, y) 
 = ux (x, y)vy (x, y) − uy (x, y)vx (x, y).

J(x, y) = det 
vx (x, y) vy (x, y) 
Hence, using the Cauchy-Riemann equations, we find that
J(x, y) = u2x (x, y) + u2y (x, y) = | f  (x + iy)|2 .
So if f  (x0 + iy0 ) = 0, then J(x0 , y0 ) = 0 and Theorem 5.7.13 follows from the
inverse function theorem for functions of two variables as claimed.
It is important to keep in mind that the condition f  (z) = 0 for all z in Ω does not
imply that f is one-to-one on Ω . Consider f (z) = ez ; then f  (z) = ez = 0 for all z, yet
f is not one-to-one on the whole complex plane. Theorem 5.7.13 only guarantees
that f is one-to-one in some neighborhood of a point z0 where f  (z0 ) = 0. Because
this neighborhood depends on z0 in general, an obvious question is whether we can
estimate its size in terms of the sizes of f and f  . An answer to this question was
provided by the German mathematician Edmund Landau (1877–1938) and is known
as Landau’s estimate. See Exercise 36.
The following two corollaries describe important properties of analytic functions,
which are direct applications of the local mapping theorem.
Corollary 5.7.14. (Open Mapping Property) Let Ω be a region. Then for a nonconstant analytic function f on Ω and an open subset U of Ω the set f [U] is open.
A function with this property is said to be open.
Proof. Let U be an open subset of Ω . Given w0 in f [U], let z0 be some point in U
where f (z0 ) = w0 . Since U is open, we can find a neighborhood BR (z0 ) contained in
Ω ; by applying Theorem 5.7.12 to BR (z0 ), we find that each point in the associated
Bρ (w0 ) is assumed by f . Thus Bρ (w0 ) is contained in f [U], and f [U] is open. 
Corollary 5.7.15. (Mapping of Regions) If Ω is a nonempty region (open and connected set) and f is a nonconstant analytic function on Ω , then f [Ω ] is a region.
Proof. By Corollary 5.7.14, f [Ω ] is open. To show that f [Ω ] is connected, suppose
that f [Ω ] = U ∪ V , where U and V are open and disjoint. Since f is continuous,

5.7 The Counting Theorem and Rouché’s Theorem

361

f −1 [U] and f −1 [V ] are open (note that since f is defined on Ω , when taking a preimage, we only consider those points in Ω ). Clearly, f −1 [U] and f −1 [V ] are disjoint
and their union is Ω . Since Ω is connected, either Ω = f −1 [U] or Ω = f −1 [V ], and

hence f [Ω ] = U or f [Ω ] = V , implying that f [Ω ] is connected.
Another interesting application of the open mapping property of analytic functions is a simple proof of the maximum principle.
Corollary 5.7.16. (Maximum Modulus Principle) If f is analytic on a region Ω ,
such that | f | attains a maximum at some point in Ω , then f is constant in Ω .
Proof. Suppose f is nonconstant. Let z0 be an
arbitrary point in Ω ; we will show that | f (z0 )|
is not a maximum. By Corollary 5.7.14, f
is open. Then for a small open ball Bε (z0 )
the set f [Bε (z0 )] is open and thus it contains a neighborhood Bρ (w0 ) of w0 = f (z0 ).
Clearly there exists w in Bρ (w0 ) such that |w| >
|w0 |. See Figure 5.63. Then w = f (z) for some
z ∈ Bε (z0 ) and | f (z)| > | f (z0 )|. Consequently
f (z0 ) does not have the largest modulus among
all the points in Bρ (w0 ) and thus | f (z0 )| cannot
be a maximum of | f |.

We next use the variant of the counting theorem to give a formula for the inverse
function of f in terms of an integral involving f .
Theorem 5.7.17. (Inverse Function Formula) Suppose that f is analytic in a
neighborhood of a point z0 and f  (z0 ) = 0. Let w0 = f (z0 ). Then there are R, ρ > 0
such that f −1 [Bρ (w0 )] ⊂ BR (z0 ), f is one-to-one on f −1 [Bρ (w0 )] and has an inverse
function g : Bρ (w0 ) → f −1 [Bρ (w0 )] which is is analytic on Bρ (w0 ) and satisfies
g(w) =

f (z) − w

w ∈ Bρ (w0 ).

(5.7.12)

Proof. Let R and ρ be as in Theorem 5.7.12. For w in Bρ (w0 ), the function f − w
has exactly one zero in BR (z0 ), which we call g(w). Applying identity (5.7.7) (with
n1 = 1, z1 = g(w), m(z1 ) = 1, n2 = 0) we see that identity (5.7.12) holds. Then g
is continuous on Bρ (w0 ), as for w → w1 we can pass the limit inside the integral in
(5.7.12) to obtain g(w) → g(w1 ). Applying Theorem 2.3.12 [with h = f ◦ g being

the identity map on Bρ (w0 )] we obtain that g is analytic on Bρ (w0 ).
Theorem 5.7.17 can be viewed as a statement about the local existence of inverse
functions. If f is one-to-one on a region Ω , there is no ambiguity in defining the
inverse function f −1 on the whole region f [Ω ]. Indeed, for w in f [Ω ], we define
f −1 (w) to be the unique z in Ω with f (z) = w. For f analytic and one-to-one, we

362

5 Residue Theory

have the following result, which should be compared to Theorem 2.3.12. Theorem 5.7.17 can be used to derive a useful formula due to Lagrange for the inversion
of power series. See Exercise 33.
A function f that is analytic and one-to-one is called a univalent function. The
next corollary says that univalent functions have global inverses.
Corollary 5.7.18. (A Global Inverse Function) Suppose that f is univalent function on a region Ω . Then its inverse function f −1 exists and is analytic on the region
f [Ω ]. Moreover,

and hence it is analytic on Ω . Also, since f is one-to-one, Theorem 5.7.13 implies
that f  (z) = 0 for all z in Ω . Differentiating both sides of the identity z = f −1 ( f (z)),
d −1
f (w) f  (z), which is equivalent to (5.7.13).

ΔC arg( f + g) on C.
26. Project Problem: Hurwitz’s theorem. We outline a proof of a useful theorem due to the
German mathematician Adolf Hurwitz (1859–1919). The theorem states the following: Suppose
that { fn }∞
n=1 is a sequence of analytic functions on a region Ω converging uniformly on every
closed and bounded subset of Ω to a function f . Then either
(i) f is identically 0 on Ω ; or
(ii) if Br (z0 ) is an open disk in Ω such that f does not vanish on Cr (z0 ), then fn and f have the
same number of zeros in Br (z0 ) for all sufficiently large n. In particular, if f is not identically 0
and f has p distinct zeros in Ω , then so do the functions fn for all sufficiently large n.
Observe that f is analytic by Theorem 4.1.10. Also, note that the theorem guarantees that, for
large n, fn and f have the same number of zeros, but these zeros are not necessarily the same for fn
and f . To see this, take fn (z) = z − 1n and f (z) = z for all z ∈ Ω . Finally, observe that the possibility
that f is identically zero can arise, even if the fn ’s are all nonzero. Simply take fn = 1n .
Fill in the details in the following proof. Suppose that f is not identically 0 in Ω . Let Br (z0 ) be
a closed disk such that f is nonvanishing on Cr (z0 ). Let m = min | f | on Cr (z0 ). Then m > 0 (why?).
Apply uniform convergence to get an index N such that n > N implies that | fn − f | < m ≤ | f | on
Cr (z0 ). Complete the proof by applying Rouché’s theorem.

5 Residue Theory

Hurwitz’s theorem has many interesting applications. We start with some theoretical properties
and then give some applications to counting zeros of analytic functions (Exercises 28–30).
27. Suppose that fn converges to f uniformly on every closed and bounded subset of a region Ω
with fn analytic and vanishing nowhere on Ω . Then either f is identically 0 or f has no zero on Ω .
28. Univalent functions. (a) Suppose that { fn }∞
n=1 is a sequence of univalent functions on a region
Ω that converges to f uniformly on every closed and bounded subset of Ω , and f is not identically
constant on Ω . Then f is univalent. [Hint: Fix z0 in Ω and apply Exercise 26 to the sequence of
functions { fn − fn (z0 )}∞
n=1 defined on Ω \ {z0 }.]
(b) Give an example of a sequence of univalent functions converging uniformly on the closed unit
disk to a constant function.
29. Counting zeros with Hurwitz’s theorem. If we want to find the number of zeros inside the
unit disk of the polynomial p(z) = z5 + z4 + 6z2 + 3z + 1, then we cannot just apply Rouché’s
theorem since there is not one single coefficient of the polynomial whose absolute value dominates
the sum of the absolute values of the other coefficients. Here is how we can handle this problem:
(a) Consider the polynomials pn = p − 1n . Show that pn converges to p uniformly on the closed
unit disk.
(b) Apply Rouché’s theorem to show that pn has two zeros in the unit disk.
(c) Apply Hurwitz’s theorem to show that p has two zeros inside the unit disk.
In Exercises 30–31, modify the steps in Exercise 29 to find the zeros of the polynomials in the
indicated region.

f  (z0 ) = 0, find r > 0 such that f is one-to-one on the open disk Br (z0 ). Landau’s solution: It
suffices to take r = R2 | f  (z0 )|/(4M), where M is the maximum value of | f | on CR (z0 ).
Fill in the details in the following argument. It suffices to choose r so that f  (z) = 0 for all z
in Br (z0 ) (why?). Without loss of generality we can take z0 = 0 and w0 = f (z0 ) = 0 (why?). Then
for |z| < R, f (z) = a1 z + a2 z2 + · · · . Write r = λ R, where 0 < λ < 1 is to be determined so that

Harmonic Functions and Applications
The mathematician’s patterns, like the painter’s or the poet’s
must be beautiful; the ideas, like the colors or the words must fit
together in a harmonious way.
-Godfrey Harold Hardy (1877–1947)

There are many important applications of complex analysis to real-world problems. The ones studied in this chapter are related to the fundamental differential
equation
∂ 2u ∂ 2u
Δ u = 2 + 2 = 0,
∂x
∂y
known as Laplace’s equation. This partial differential equation models phenomena
in engineering and physics, such as steady-state temperature distributions, electrostatic potentials, and fluid flow, just to name a few. A real-valued function that satisfies Laplace’s equation is said to be harmonic. There is an intimate relationship
between harmonic and analytic functions. This is investigated in Section 6.1 along
with other fundamental properties of harmonic functions.
To illustrate an application, consider a twoy
dimensional plate of homogeneous material,
with insulated lateral surfaces. We represent
this plate by a region Ω in the complex plane
Plate
(see Figure 6.1). Suppose that the temperature
u
of the points on the boundary of the plate is

described by the function b(x, y) that does not
change with time. It is a fact of thermodynamBoundary of

equation Δ u = 0.
The Laplacian is named after the great French mathematician and physicist
Pierre-Simon de Laplace (1749–1827). This operator appeared for the first time
in a memoir of Laplace in 1784, in which he completely determined the attraction
of a spheroid on the points outside it. The Laplacian of a function measures the
difference between the value of the function at a point and the average value of the
function in a neighborhood of that point. Thus a function that does not vary abruptly
has a very small Laplacian. Harmonic functions have a zero Laplacian; they vary in
a very regular way. Examples of such functions include the temperature distribution

in a plate, the potential of the attractive force due to a sphere, or the function that
gives the brightness of colors in an image.

6.1 Harmonic Functions
Definition 6.1.1. A real-valued function u defined on an open subset Ω of the complex plane is called harmonic if it has continuous partial derivatives of first and
second order in Ω and satisfies Laplace’s equation

Δu =

∂ 2u ∂ 2u
+
=0
∂ x2 ∂ y2

for all (x, y) in Ω .

(6.1.1)

Examples of harmonic functions exist in abundance. In fact the real and imaginary parts of analytic functions are harmonic. Let us verify this assertion. Consider an analytic function f = u + iv on an open set Ω . We know that u and v have
derivatives of all orders (Corollary 3.8.9) and satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations
(Theorem 2.5.1):
∂u ∂v

for all (x, y) in Ω . In other words, u and v satisfy Laplace’s equation. We have
therefore proved the following important result.
Theorem 6.1.2. The real and imaginary parts of analytic functions defined on open
sets are harmonic.
This result effectively provides us with many examples of harmonic functions;
simply consider the real or imaginary parts of analytic functions.
Example 6.1.3. (Harmonic functions) Show that the following functions are harmonic in the stated regions.
(a) u(x, y) = x2 − y2 on C.
(b) u(x, y) = ex sin y on C.

6.1 Harmonic Functions

369

(c) u(x, y) = Arg z (z =
x + iy) on the region Ω = C \ (−∞, 0].
(d) u(x, y) = ln |z| = ln x2 + y2 on the region C \ {0}.
Solution. (a) It is not hard to see that u is harmonic here by direct verification of
Laplace’s equation, but we recognize that u(x, y) = x2 − y2 is the real part of the
entire function f (z) = z2 = (x2 − y2 ) + 2ixy. Thus from Theorem 6.1.2 we conclude
that u is harmonic on C.
(b) Recognizing u(x, y) = ex sin y as the imaginary part of the entire function ez
(Corollary 1.6.4), we conclude from Theorem 6.1.2 that u is harmonic on C.
(c) We have Arg z = Im ( Log z), where Log z = ln |z|+i Arg z is the principal branch
of the logarithm defined in (1.8.4). Since Log z is analytic on Ω , we conclude that
Arg z is harmonic on Ω , by Theorem 6.1.2.
(d) We need two different analytic functions to establish the claim. Arguing
as

in (c), it follows that ln |z| = ln x2 + y2
is harmonic on Ω = C \ (−∞, 0], being
the real part of Log z, which is analytic
on C \ (−∞, 0]. This establishes that ln |z|
is harmonic on the desired region except
on the negative x-axis, (−∞, 0). To show
that ln |z| is harmonic on (−∞, 0), we use
logα z, which is a branch of log z with
branch cut at angle α , with −π < α < π .

It follows from (1.8.6) that logα z = ln |z| + argα z and logα z is analytic except at
the branch cut and, in particular, is analytic on the negative x-axis. Hence, its real
part, ln |z|, is harmonic on the negative x-axis. See Figure 6.2.

We may also answer part (d) directly by verifying that ln x2 + y2 = 12 ln(x2 +y2 )
satisfies Laplace’s equation and the first and second partial derivatives are continuous everywhere except at the origin.

Proposition 6.1.4. Suppose that u and v are harmonic on an open set S, and a, b
are real constants. Then the function a u + b v is harmonic on S.
Proof. The proof is left to the reader.



Example 6.1.5. (a) The function φ (x, y) = 2(x2 − y2 ) + 7 is harmonic on C, being
the linear combination of the harmonic functions x2 − y2 and 7.
(b) The function φ (x, y) = (a x + b)(c y + d), where a, b, c, d are real constants, is
harmonic, being a linear combination of the harmonic functions x, y, xy, and constants.
(c) The product of two harmonic functions need not be harmonic. For instance, the

2
function u(x, y) = x is harmonic but u(x, y) = x2 is not.

We have seen that analytic functions have derivatives of all orders (Corollary 3.8.9). The same is true for harmonic functions. The proof of this result is
facilitated via a definition and a lemma.

6 Harmonic Functions and Applications

Definition 6.1.6. For a harmonic function u on Ω , the function φ = ux − i uy defined
on Ω is called the conjugate gradient of u.
Lemma 6.1.7. (Analyticity of the Conjugate Gradient) Suppose that u is harmonic on a region Ω . Then its conjugate gradient is analytic on Ω .
Proof. Write φ = Re (φ ) + i Im (φ ) = ux − i uy . Since u has continuous second partial derivatives, it follows that Re φ and Im φ have continuous first partial derivatives. To show that φ is analytic, in view of Corollary 2.5.2, it suffices to show that
Re φ and Im φ satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations. Indeed, we have

∂
∂
Re φ =
ux = uxx
∂x
∂x

and

∂
∂
Im φ =
(−uy ) = −uyy .
∂y
∂y

But as u is harmonic, uxx = −uyy , and so ∂∂x Re φ = ∂∂y Im φ . Thus, the first of the
Cauchy-Riemann equations is satisfied. Now, since u has continuous second partial
derivatives, we have uxy = uyx . Thus

∂
Re φ = uxy
∂y

and

∂
Im φ = −uyx = −uxy .
∂x

So ∂∂y Re φ = − ∂∂x Im φ and the second of the Cauchy-Riemann equations holds.

Hence φ is analytic on Ω .

Since f is analytic for all z = 0, it follows that its real part u = r−1 cos θ is harmonic
for all z = 0 by Theorem 6.1.2. In particular, u is harmonic in the upper half-plane.

(b) We have
ux =

Suppose that f = u + i v is analytic on a region Ω . From the Cauchy-Riemann
equations, f  (z) = ux − iuy , and thus f  is the conjugate gradient of u; equivalently,
f is an antiderivative of the conjugate gradient of u. This fact allows us to use the
conjugate gradient to construct f when only Re f = u is known. In Example 6.1.8,
x

1
u(x, y) = x2 +y
2 = Re ( f (z)) where f (z) = z = x+i y and the conjugate gradient of u

is φ (z) = − z12 = f  (z).
Using the conjugate gradient φ = ux − i uy , we can express partial derivatives of u
as the real or imaginary part of an analytic function, namely a derivative of φ . For example, to obtain uxxx , differentiate φ with respect to x twice and get φ  = uxxx −i uyxx .
(Note that since the derivatives of φ exist, we can obtain them by differentiating with
respect to any one of the variables x, y, or z). Since φ is analytic, all its higher-order
derivatives are analytic (Corollary 3.8.9), and so uxxx and uyxx are both harmonic by
Theorem 6.1.2. We can carry these ideas further and arrive at the following useful
result.
Corollary 6.1.9. A harmonic function defined on a region has continuous partial
derivatives of all orders.
We now discuss a result concerning the composition of a harmonic function with
an analytic one.
Theorem 6.1.10. Let f be analytic on a region Ω , and let w be a function with
two continuous partial derivatives defined on a region that contains f [Ω ]. Then the
identity holds:
Δ (w ◦ f ) = | f  |2 Δ w.
(6.1.3)
Moreover, if w is harmonic, then w ◦ f is harmonic on Ω .
Proof. We write f (x+iy) = u(x+iy)+iv(x+iy). Since f is analytic, Theorem 6.1.2
gives that u and v are harmonic, and thus they satisfy uxx + uyy = 0, vxx + vyy = 0 on
their domains. We have
(w ◦ f )x = wu ux + wv vx
(w ◦ f )y = wu uy + wv vy
and another differentiation using Leibniz’s rule yields:
(w ◦ f )xx = wuu (ux )2 + wuv ux vx + wu uxx + wvv (vx )2 + wvu vx ux + wv vxx
(w ◦ f )yy = wuu (uy )2 + wuv uy vy + wu uyy + wvv (vy )2 + wvu vy uy + wv vyy .

372

6 Harmonic Functions and Applications

Adding these equations and using that uxx + vyy = 0, vxx + vyy = 0 and that ux vx +
uy vy = 0 (which is a consequence of the Cauchy-Riemann identity (2.5.7) in Theorem 2.5.1), we deduce that
(w ◦ f )xx + (w ◦ f )yy = wuu (ux )2 + wuu (uy )2 + wvv (vx )2 + wvv (vy )2
= wuu (ux )2 + wuu (vx )2 + wvv (vx )2 + wvv (ux )2



= wuu + wvv (ux )2 + (vx )2
and so (6.1.3) follows. If w is harmonic, then Δ w = 0 and it follows from (6.1.3)

that Δ (w ◦ f ) = 0, and thus w ◦ f is harmonic if w is harmonic.

Harmonic Conjugates
Definition 6.1.11. Suppose that u and v are harmonic functions that satisfy the
Cauchy-Riemann equations on some open set Ω ; in other words, the function
f = u + i v is analytic in Ω . Then v is called the harmonic conjugate of u.
Can we always find a harmonic conjugate of a harmonic function u? As it turns
out, the answer depends on the function u and its domain of definition. For example,
the function ln |z| is harmonic in Ω = C \ {0} (Example 6.1.3(d)), but ln |z| has no
harmonic conjugate in that region (Exercise 34). It does, however, have a harmonic
conjugate in C \ (−∞, 0], namely Arg z. Our next example shows one way of using
the Cauchy-Riemann equations to find the harmonic conjugate in a region such as
the entire complex plane, a disk, or a rectangle.
Example 6.1.12. (Finding harmonic conjugates) Show that u(x, y) = x2 − y2 + x
is harmonic in the entire plane and find a harmonic conjugate for it.
Solution. That u is harmonic follows from uxx = 2 and uyy = −2. To find a harmonic
conjugate v, we use the Cauchy-Riemann equations as follows. We want u + i v to
be analytic. Hence v must satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations

∂u ∂v
=

∂x ∂y
Since

∂y

(6.1.4)

= 2x + 1, the first equation implies that
2x + 1 =

∂v
.
∂y

To get v we integrate both sides of this equation with respect to y. However, since
v is a function of x and y, the constant of integration may be a function of x. Thus
integrating with respect to y yields
v(x, y) = (2x + 1)y + c(x),
where c(x) is a function of x alone. Plugging this into the second equation in (6.1.4),
we get

and hence c(x) has zero derivative and must be a constant. We pick such constant
and write c(x) = C. Substituting into the expression for v we get
v(x, y) = (2x + 1)y + c(x) = 2xy + y +C.
The pair of functions u and v satisfies the Cauchy-Riemann equations, and thus the

function (x2 − y2 + x) + i (2xy + y +C) is entire.
So, from Example 6.1.12, a harmonic conjugate of u(x, y) = x2 − y2 + x is
v(x, y) = 2xy + y. What is a harmonic conjugate of v(x, y) = 2xy + y? Surely it is
related to u. Indeed, you can check that a conjugate of v is −u(x, y) = −x2 + y2 − x.
More generally, we have the following useful result.
Proposition 6.1.13. Suppose that u is harmonic on an open set Ω and that v is a
harmonic conjugate of u on Ω . Then −u is a harmonic conjugate of v on Ω .
Proof. We know that f = u+iv is analytic on Ω . It follows that the function (−i) f =

v − iu is analytic on Ω , and hence −u is a harmonic conjugate of v on Ω .
In Example 6.1.12, we found the harmonic conjugate of u up to an arbitrary
additive real constant. In fact, the following properties of the harmonic conjugate
are not hard to prove and are left to the reader.
Proposition 6.1.14. Suppose that u is a harmonic function in a region Ω . Then
(i) if v1 and v2 are harmonic conjugates of u in Ω , then v1 and v2 must differ by a
real constant.
(ii) If v is a harmonic conjugate of u, then v is also a harmonic conjugate of u + c
where c is a real constant.
Remark 6.1.15. Notice that in the hypothesis of Proposition 6.1.14 we are assuming
that Ω is a connected set. Otherwise the constant c in assertion (ii) may vary on each
different connected component of Ω .
Our next result guarantees the existence of harmonic conjugates on simply connected regions.
Theorem 6.1.16. (Existence of Harmonic Conjugates) Suppose that u is a harmonic function on a simply connected region Ω . Let z0 be a fixed point in Ω and
γ (z0 , z) be a path that joins z0 to an arbitrary point z in Ω . Then the function
v(z) =

γ (z0 ,z)

−uy dx + ux dy

is a harmonic conjugate of u in Ω ; the integral is independent of the path.

Proof. Consider the analytic conjugate gradient φ = ux − i uy . The integral of φ is
independent of path in Ω , in view of Corollary 3.6.9. Define
f (z) =

γ (z0 ,z)

φ (ζ ) d ζ .

Then f is analytic and f  = φ . Write ζ = x + i y, d ζ = dx + i dy. Then

f (z) =

γ (z0 ,z)

−uy dx + ux dy .

We claim that

γ (z0 ,z)

ux dx + uy dy = u(z) − u(z0 ).

From this it will follow that v(z) = γ (z0 ,z) −uy dx + ux dy is a harmonic conjugate of
u(z), since (u − u(z0 )) + i v = f is analytic as the additive constant u(z0 ) does not
affect analyticity. To prove the claim, parametrize the path from z0 to z by ζ (t) =
x(t) + i y(t), a ≤ t ≤ b. Then

Suppose that u is harmonic on a region Ω , and let z0 be in Ω . Since Ω is
open, we can find an open disk BR (z0 ) in
Ω . Since BR (z0 ) is simply connected, u
has a harmonic conjugate in BR (z0 ). This
means that Theorem 6.1.16 holds locally
in Ω (Figure 6.4). This is a useful fact that
we record in the following corollary.

Suppose that two curves C1 and C2
meet at a point A. The curves are said
to be orthogonal if their respective
tangent lines L1 and L2 (at A) are orthogonal (Figure 6.5). We also say
that C1 and C2 intersect at a right angle at A. Recall that if m1 and m2 denote the respective slopes of the tangent lines, and if neither is zero, then
L1 and L2 are orthogonal if and only
if

Consider the level curves of a harmonic function u in a region Ω . These are the
curves determined by the implicit relation
u(x, y) = C1 ,

(6.1.7)

where C1 is a constant (in the range of u). Since u is harmonic, it has continuous

where C2 is a constant (in the range of v). Since v is harmonic, arguing as for u, we

since by the Cauchy-Riemann equations, ∂ v/∂ x = −∂ u/∂ y and ∂ v/∂ y = ∂ u/∂ x.
Comparing (6.1.9) and (6.1.10), we see that the slopes of the tangent lines satisfy
the orthogonality relation (6.1.6), and hence the level curves of u are orthogonal to
the level curves of v. This orthogonality relation also holds when the tangents are
horizontal and vertical. We thus have the following result.
Theorem 6.1.18. (Orthogonality of Level Curves) Suppose that u is a harmonic
function in a region Ω , and let v be a harmonic conjugate of u in Ω , so that f =
u + i v is analytic in Ω . Then, the two families of level curves, u(x, y) = C1 and
v(x, y) = C2 , are orthogonal at every point z = x + i y for which f  (z) = 0.
As an illustration, we show in Figure 6.6 the level curves of the harmonic function
u = x2 − y2 + x and in Figure 6.7 the level curves of its conjugate v(x, y) = 2xy + y
(see Example 6.1.12). The graphs of the two families are superposed in Figure 6.8
to illustrate their orthogonality.

Mean Value and Maximum/Minimum Modulus Principle
Using the local existence of a harmonic conjugate, we obtain the mean value property of harmonic functions from the corresponding property of analytic functions.
Corollary 6.1.19. (Gauss’ Mean Value Property) Let u be a harmonic function on
a region Ω . Then u satisfies the mean value property in the following sense: If z is
in Ω , and the closed disk Br (z) (r > 0) is contained in Ω , then
u(z) =

1
2π

 2π
0

u(z + reit ) dt.

(6.1.11)

Proof. Let B be an open disk in Ω containing the closed disk Br (z0 ). Since B is
simply connected, u has a harmonic conjugate v in B. So f = u + i v is analytic in B.

Now take real parts on both sides to obtain (6.1.11).

We now prove the maximum-minimum modulus principle for harmonic functions. Note the role of connectedness in the proof.
Theorem 6.1.20. (Maximum and Minimum Modulus Principle) Suppose that u
is a harmonic function on a region Ω . If u attains a maximum or a minimum in Ω ,
then u is constant in Ω .
Proof. By considering −u, we need only to prove the statement for maxima. We
first prove the result under the assumption that Ω is simply connected. Applying
Theorem 6.1.16 we find an analytic function f = u + i v on Ω . Consider the function
g = e f = eu eiv .
Then g is analytic in Ω and |g| = eu . Since the real exponential function is strictly
increasing, a maximum of eu corresponds to a maximum of u. By Theorem 3.9.6,
if |g| attains a maximum or a minimum in Ω , then g is constant, implying that u is
constant in Ω .
We now deal with an arbitrary region Ω . Suppose that u attains a maximum M at
a point in Ω . Let

Ω0 = {z ∈ Ω : u(z) < M}
Ω1 = {z ∈ Ω : u(z) = M}.
We have Ω = Ω0 ∪ Ω1 , Ω0 is open, and Ω1 is nonempty by assumption. It is enough
to show that Ω1 is open. By connectedness this will imply that Ω = Ω1 .
Suppose that z0 is in Ω1 , and let Br (z0 )
be an open disk in Ω centered at z0 (Figure 6.9). Since Br (z0 ) is simply connected
and the restriction of u to Br (z0 ) is a harmonic function that attains its maximum
at z0 inside Br (z0 ), it follows from the
previous case that u is constant in Br (z0 ).
Thus u(z) = M for all z in Br (z0 ), implying that Br (z0 ) is contained in Ω1 . Hence
Ω1 is open.

results regarding the modulus of analytic functions. We relegate their proofs to the
exercises.

(i) u attains its maximum M and minimum m on the boundary of Ω ;
(ii) either u is constant or m < u < M for all points in Ω .

6.2 Dirichlet Problems
To determine the steady-state temperature distribution inside a plate Ω , we must
solve Laplace’s equation inside Ω subject to the condition that u(x, y) is a given
function b(x, y) on the boundary of Ω ; such a condition is known as a boundary condition. A problem consisting of a partial differential equation along with
specified boundary conditions is known as a boundary value problem. The spe-

380

6 Harmonic Functions and Applications

cial case involving Laplace’s equation with specified boundary values is known as a
Dirichlet problem. Solving Dirichlet problems is of paramount importance in applied mathematics, engineering, and physics. Many methods have been developed
for this purpose. The ones that we present in this section provide beautiful applications of complex analysis.

Solving and Interpreting Dirichlet Problems
An interesting example of a harmonic function is u(x, y) = a Arg z + b, which is
harmonic on C \ (−∞, 0] by Example 6.1.3(c) and Proposition 6.1.4. Because Arg z
is constant on rays (independent of r), it follows that u = a Arg z + b is also constant
on rays. (In fact, this is the only harmonic function with such a property. See Exercise 7.) Thus u is a good candidate for a solution of Dirichlet problems in which the
boundary data is constant on rays or independent of r. We illustrate these ideas with
an example.
Example 6.2.1. (Dirichlet problem in a quadrant)
The boundary of a very large sheet
of metal (thought of as the quarter
plane Ω ) is kept at the constant temperatures 100◦ on the bottom and
50◦ on the left, as illustrated in Figure 6.10. After a long enough period
of time, the temperature inside the
plate reaches an equilibrium distribution. Find this steady-state temperature u(x, y).
Fig. 6.10 Dirichlet problem on Ω .

Solution. The steady-state temperature is a solution of the Dirichlet problem, which
consists of Laplace’s equation

Δ u = 0,

inside Ω ;

along with the boundary conditions
u(x, 0) = 100, x > 0,

u(0, y) = 50, y > 0.

Based on our discussion preceding the example, because the boundary data is independent of r = |x + i y|, we try for a solution of the harmonic function
u(x, y) = a Arg (x + i y) + b,

6.2 Dirichlet Problems

381

where a and b are real constants to be determined so as to satisfy the boundary
conditions. From the first condition we obtain
u(x, 0) = 100 ⇒ a Arg x + b = 100 ⇒ b = 100,
as Arg x = 0 for x > 0. From the second condition
u(0, y) = 50 ⇒ a Arg (iy) + b = 50
π
⇒ a + 100 = 50

since Arg (iy) = π2 for y > 0, and b = 100.
Thus the steady-state temperature inside
the plate is

picture representing the temperature distribution of the
plate. Note the boundary values

The graph of u is shown in Figure 6.11. Note the temperature on the boundary; it
matches the boundary conditions.

In contrast to Arg z we can find harmonic functions which are independent of the
argument and depend only on r = |z|. An example of such a function is
u(z) = a ln |z| + b,
where a and b are real constants. By Example 6.1.3(d), this function is harmonic
in C \ {0}. It is a good candidate for a solution of Dirichlet problems in which the
boundary data is constant on circles. See Exercises 29–32 for illustrations.
Example 6.2.2. (Dirichlet problem in an infinite strip) Solve the Dirichlet problem shown in Figure 6.12.

382

6 Harmonic Functions and Applications

Solution. Since the boundary data does
not depend on x, it is plausible to guess
that the solution will also not depend on x.
In this case, the function u(x, y) depends
on y alone, hence ux = 0 and uxx = 0,
and Laplace’s equation becomes uyy = 0,
implying that u is a linear function of y.
Hence u(x, y) = a y + b. Using the boundary conditions, we have
u(x, 0) = 0 ⇒ b = 0;
u(x, 1) = 100 ⇒ a = 100.

Fig. 6.12 Dirichlet problem in
Example 6.2.2

Hence the solution of the problem is u(x, y) = 100 y, which is clearly harmonic
and satisfies the boundary conditions.

In Example 6.2.2 we used a harmonic function that was independent of x. Similarly, we can find harmonic functions that are independent of y (hence uy = 0 and
uyy = 0). In this case we have that u = a x + b, where a and b are real constants. This
function is a good candidate for solving Dirichlet problems in infinite vertical strips
with constant boundary data. On this, see Exercises 1 and 2.

Harmonic Conjugates, Isotherms, and Heat Flow
In Example 6.2.1, the temperature of the boundary is kept at two constant values,
100◦ and 50◦ . Our physical intuition tells us that, as the plate is insulated, the temperature values of the points inside the plate vary between these two values and equal
those values only at the boundary. It is natural to ask for those points (x, y) inside
the plate with the same temperature u(x, y) = T , where 50 < T < 100. These points
lie on curves inside the plate, called curves of constant temperature or isotherms.
Isotherms have many practical applications. Computing them leads to interesting
properties of harmonic functions.
Example 6.2.3. (Isotherms) Find the isotherms in Example 6.2.1.
Solution. Since the temperature inside the plate will vary between 50◦ and 100◦ , to
find the isotherms, we must solve
u(x, y) = T,

where

50 < T < 100,

where (x, y) is a point inside the first quadrant, not on the boundary. Appealing to

Fig. 6.13 The isotherms in Example 6.2.1.

Related to the topic of isotherms is the topic of curves of heat flow. These are the
curves along which the heat is flowing inside the plate. To determine these curves,
we use Fourier’s law of heat conduction, which states that heat flows from hot to
cold in the direction in which the temperature difference is the greatest. Clearly the
change in temperature is greatest along directions moving away from the isotherms,
i.e., along curves perpendicular to them. Hence the curves of heat flow are orthogonal to the isotherms.
Recall from vector calculus that the gradient vector ∇u = (ux , uy ) points in
the direction of greatest change in a function. The gradient is perpendicular to the
level curves of u(x, y). Fourier’s law states that heat flows along −∇u, and thus
curves of heat flow are orthogonal to level curves of u, and hence coincident with
level curves of v. So to find the curves of heat flow in a plate, it is enough to find a
harmonic conjugate v(x, y) of the steady-state temperature distribution u(x, y), since
by Theorem 6.1.18 the level curves of v are orthogonal to the level curves of u.

So far we have used our knowledge of analytic functions to solve Dirichlet problems by guessing the solution. Guessing is certainly a legitimate method that can
be used in solving differential equations and computing indefinite integrals. Further development of the theory of analytic and harmonic functions will be necessary
to tackle more general Dirichlet problems. Topics such as the Poisson integral formula, Fourier series, and conformal mappings are examples of theories and tools
that provide us with systematic ways for solving Dirichlet problems.
Other issues that could be addressed concern the uniqueness of the solution of a
Dirichlet problem. Consider the problem in Example 6.2.1, whose solution is
u(x, y) = −

100 −1  y 
+ 100.
tan
π
x

If we add to this solution the harmonic function φ (x, y) = xy, we obtain the harmonic function ψ (x, y) = u(x, y) + xy, which solves Laplace’s equation. Moreover,
because xy vanishes on the boundary of the first quadrant, ψ and u have the same

6.2 Dirichlet Problems

boundary values. Thus, ψ is another solution of the Dirichlet problem in Example 6.2.1. This situation is counterintuitive since we would like to think of the solution as representing a temperature distribution and as such it must be unique. As it
turns out, on unbounded regions, such as the one in Example 6.2.1, if we require the
(natural) condition that the temperature distribution be bounded, then the solution
will be unique. For example, with this additional boundedness assumption, we can
no longer add the function xy to the solution in Example 6.2.1 to obtain another
solution.

6.3 Dirichlet Problem and the Poisson Integral on a Disk
In this section we consider the Dirichlet problem on a disk and derive an interesting
formula for its solution. For convenience, we use polar coordinates. Suppose that a
bounded piecewise continuous function f (θ ) represents boundary data of the points
Reiθ , 0 ≤ R < 1, θ ∈ R (Figure 6.21). Since θ and θ + 2π represent the same polar
angle, we think of f as being 2π -periodic; that is f (θ + 2π ) = f (θ ) for all θ . Our
problem is to find a function u(reiθ ) such that

Δ u(r eiθ ) = 0,
u(R eiθ ) = f (θ ),

0 ≤ r < R, 0 < θ ≤ 2π ;
0 < θ ≤ 2π ,

(6.3.1)
(6.3.2)

where the equality holds at all points of continuity of f (Figures 6.21, 6.22).

Fig. 6.21 The boundary values
of u are f (θ ) = u(R eiθ ).

i.e., a finite linear combination of functions from the 2π -periodic trigonometric system: 1, cos x, cos 2x, . . . , sin x, sin 2x, . . ..

(6.3.4)

Proof. For |z| < R, write z = reiθ = r(cos θ + i sin θ ). The function


f (z) = zn = rn cos(nθ ) + i sin(nθ )
is analytic on the disk |z| < R. Hence its real and imaginary parts are harmonic
(Theorem 6.1.2). This shows that the functions 1, r cos θ , r2 cos(2θ ), . . . , r sin θ ,
r2 sin(2θ ), . . . are harmonic (in the variable reiθ ) on the disk BR (0). By Proposition 6.1.4, linear combinations of such functions are also harmonic on the unit disk,
and so (6.3.4) is harmonic. Setting r = R in (6.3.4), we see that u(R eiθ ) = f (θ ),
where f is as in (6.3.3). Hence (6.3.4) is the solution of the Dirichlet problem with
boundary data (6.3.3).

Example 6.3.2. (A steady-state problem on a disk)
The temperature on the boundary of a circular plate of radius 1 with insulated lateral surface and center placed at the origin
is a function of the radial angle θ which

the formula f (θ ) = 50 − 50 cos θ (Figure 6.24).

Solution. (a) To find the steady-state temperature, we must solve the Dirichlet
problem with boundary data f . According to (6.3.4), the solution is u(r, θ ) =
50 − 50 r cos θ , 0 ≤ r < 1. This function is harmonic and equals f (θ ) when r = 1
(Figure 6.25).
(b) Since the temperature on the boundary varies between 0 and 100, by the
maximum-minimum principle for harmonic functions, the temperature inside the
plate will vary between these two limits. To find the isotherms, let 0 < T < 100 and
solve the equation u(r, θ ) = T or 50 − 50r cos θ = T . Using x = r cos θ , the equation
becomes 50 − 50x = T or x = 50−T
50 . Thus the isotherms are the intersections with
the unit disk of the vertical lines x = 50−T
50 . The isotherms vary between x = 1 and
x = −1 as T varies between 0 and 100. In view of Theorem 6.1.18 the heat flows
along the curves that are orthogonal to the isotherms. In this case, it is not difficult
to verify that heat flows inside the unit disk in the direction of the horizontal lines
y = b (Figure 6.26).

6 Harmonic Functions and Applications

In the next section, we show that the solution of the Dirichlet problem with arbitrary piecewise continuous boundary data f can be expressed in the form (6.3.4) if
we allow the series to have infinitely many terms. The series we thus obtain is called
Fourier series.

Poisson’s Integral Formula
The solution of the Dirichlet problem on the disk can be expressed as an integral
involving the boundary function, known as the Poisson integral formula.
Suppose that u is a harmonic function on the open unit disk, continuous on the
closed disk B1 (0), and equal to a given function f on the boundary of the disk. Then
the mean value property of u at 0 (Corollary 6.1.19) implies that

u(0) =
2π

 2π
0

1
u(e ) d θ =
2π
iθ

 2π
0

f (θ ) d θ ,

where f is the boundary function. In this equation, the value of u at the center of the
disk is expressed as an integral of the boundary function f . Our goal is to derive an
integral formula for all other values of u(z0 ), where z0 is a point inside the unit disk.
For fixed |z0 | < 1, consider the linear fractional transformation

φ−z0 (z) =

z + z0
,
1 + z0 z

|z| < 1.

We know from Proposition 4.6.2 that φ−z0 (z) is analytic and one-to-one and maps
the unit disk onto itself and the unit circle, C1 (0), onto itself. Let
U(z) = u ◦ φ−z0 (z),

|z| < 1.

In view of Theorem 6.1.10, U is harmonic on the open unit disk. Applying the mean
value property of U at 0, we find that
u(z0 ) = U(0) =

1
2π

 2π
0

U(eit ) dt =

 2π

u ◦ φ−z0 (eit ) dt.

(6.3.5)

Thus the value of u at the interior point z0 is expressed as an integral involving the
boundary values of u ◦ φ−z0 . To get the desired formula that involves the boundary
values of u, we will perform the change of variables
eis = φ−z0 (eit ).
Recall that φ−z0 maps the unit circle into itself and the inverse of φ−z0 is φz0 . So

(6.3.6)

This is the Poisson integral formula on the unit disk. If u is harmonic in a disk
of radius R > 0, centered at the origin, we consider the function u(Rz), which is
harmonic in |z| < 1, and so according to (6.3.6),
u(Rz0 ) =

(6.3.7)

This is the Poisson integral formula on the disk of radius R > 0, centered at the
origin. Another common way of expressing the Poisson integral formula is obtained
by realizing that for z = reiθ , 0 < r < R,
|Reiφ − z|2 = (Reiφ − reiθ )(Re−iφ − re−iθ ) = R2 − 2rR cos(θ − φ ) + r2 ;
and so from (6.3.7) (with the variable s replaced by φ ) we obtain the alternative

The importance of (6.3.8) lies in the fact that it recovers a harmonic function u
in the disk BR (0) from only its (piecewise continuous) values on the circle CR (0).
Precisely, we have the following result.
Definition 6.3.3. The Poisson kernel on the disk BR (0) is the function

P(r, θ ) = Re

R + z R2 − |z|2

(6.3.10)

Thus P(r, θ ) is a harmonic function of reiθ on the disk BR (0).
Proof. For z = reiθ and 0 ≤ r < R define
V (z) =

R+z

R−z

|z| < R.

Then V is analytic on the disk |z| < R. Moreover, we have

Note that this is a positive function that coincides with that in (6.3.9). Applying
Theorem 6.1.2, we find that ReV (z) is a harmonic function.

6.3 Dirichlet Problem and the Poisson Integral on a Disk

The following result guarantees the existence of a unique solution to the Dirichlet
problem on a disk.
Theorem 6.3.6. (Poisson’s Integral Formula) Consider the Dirichlet problem
(6.3.1) on the disk |z| ≤ R, with boundary conditions u(R eiθ ) = f (θ ), where f is
a 2π -periodic and piecewise continuous function on the line. Let 0 ≤ r < R. Then

is a unique solution to this Dirichlet problem. Precisely, u is harmonic in the open
disk BR (0) and u(reiθ ) → f (θ ) as r ↑ R at all points of continuity of f .
Proof. The function u in (6.3.13) can be written as
u(r eiθ ) =

and if we know that the expressions in the square brackets in (6.3.14) are analytic
functions of z, then u will be harmonic in view of Theorem 6.1.2. To show this, let
t1 < t2 < · · · < tM be the points of discontinuity of f in the interval [0, 2π ]. Then we
write the first term in (6.3.14) as

Note that since f is piecewise continuous (see Definition 3.2.1), it has left and right
limits at the t j and t j+1 and can be redefined to be continuous from the right at t j and
from the left at t j+1 ; the same is true for f1 and f2 . Then the integrand in (6.3.15)
is a continuous function in φ and analytic in z. Using Theorem 3.8.5 we deduce
that the expression in the square brackets in (6.3.15) is an analytic function of z. We
conclude that u is harmonic on BR (0) by Theorem 6.1.2.
It remains to show that the limit of u(reiθ0 ) as r ↑ R equals f (θ0 ) for every point
θ0 at which f is continuous. First note that f is a bounded function, and let M be
a bound for | f |. Let θ0 be a point of continuity of f . Given ε > 0 there is a δ > 0
(which can be taken to be smaller than π ) such that

ε
|φ | < δ =⇒ | f (φ − θ0 ) − f (θ0 )| < .

and this can be made less than ε /2 provided r ∈ (r0 , R) for some choice of r0 , in view

for r sufficiently close to R, that is, limr↑R u(reiθ0 ) = f (θ0 ) if f is continuous at θ0 .
If u1 and u2 are solutions of the Dirichlet problem (6.3.1) and (6.3.2), then u1 −u2
will be a harmonic function on the disk BR (0) which extends continuously to the
zero function on the boundary. Then Corollary 6.1.21 implies that u1 − u2 = 0 on

BR (0). The same conclusion also follows directly from Corollary 6.1.23.
The following corollary asserts that we can express the mean value of a harmonic
function on the unit disk in terms of its values on the boundary of the disk, on which
it may not even be continuous.
Corollary 6.3.7. (Mean Value Property) Suppose that u is harmonic on BR (0) and
u(Reiφ ) = f (φ ), where f is a 2π -periodic and piecewise continuous function on the
line. Then
u(0) =

f (φ ) d φ .

Proof. The result is obtained by evaluating (6.3.13) at r = 0.

The Poisson formula is difficult to evaluate, even for simple boundary data. For
this reason, we later develop alternative forms of the solution, including some that
are based on Fourier series.

The Fourier coefficients of piecewise continuous functions are always unique.
This requires some work to prove in general, but the case below is straightforward.

n=1 (|an | + |bn |) < ∞. Then a0 = an = bn = 0 for all n ≥ 1.
Proof. Let

(6.4.16)

In view of the hypothesis ∑∞
n=1 (|an +|bn |) < ∞, Theorem 4.1.7 implies that the series

Conformal Mappings
First, it is necessary to study the facts, to multiply the number
of observations, and then later to search for formulas that connect them so as thus to discern the particular laws governing
a certain class of phenomena. In general, it is not until after
these particular laws have been established that one can expect
to discover and articulate the more general laws that complete
theories by bringing a multitude of apparently very diverse phenomena together under a single governing principle
-Augustin-Louis Cauchy (1789–1857)

This chapter presents a sampling of successful applications of complex analysis in applied mathematics, engineering, and physics. After laying down the theory
and methods of conformal mappings we discuss Dirichlet problems; in particular,
we derive Poisson’s integral formula in the upper half-plane and other regions, by
performing a suitable change of variables. In Section 7.4, we broaden the scope
of our applications with the Schwarz-Christoffel transformation, which is a method
for finding conformal mappings of regions bounded by polygonal paths. The section
contains interesting applications from fluid flow.
In Section 7.5, we derive a Poisson integral formula for simply connected regions
in terms of the so-called Green’s function. The solution is based on a simple change
of variables and the mean value property of harmonic functions. This approach illustrates in a natural way the applicability of Green’s functions to the solution of
boundary value problems.
In Section 7.6, we tackle other famous boundary value problems, including
Laplace’s equation and Poisson’s equation. We follow the approach of changing
variables using conformal mappings, and we derive general formulas for the solutions in terms of Green’s functions and the Neumann function. Both functions are
computed explicitly in important special cases.

7.1 Basic Properties
In this section we present some basic mapping properties of analytic functions.
These properties will be useful in the solutions of partial differential equations in2
2
volving the Laplacian Δ u = ∂∂ xu2 + ∂∂ yu2 . We start with a review from calculus of the
notion of tangent lines to curves in parametric form. We state these results using the
convenient complex notation.

Suppose that γ is a smooth path parametrized by z(t) = x(t) + i y(t), a ≤ t ≤ b.
Assume that z (t) = x (t) + iy (t) = 0 for all t, which guarantees the existence of
a tangent. The tangent line to the curve at z0 = z(t) has direction of z (t); we can
characterize this direction by specifying arg z (t) (see Figure 7.1). Thus the direction
of the tangent line at a point on a path z(t) is determined by the argument of z (t).

section, let us consider the simple example of a linear mapping f (z) = az + b, where
a = 0 and b are complex numbers. As usual, we consider a mapping as taking points
in the z-plane to points in the w-plane. Using our geometric interpretation of addition and multiplication of complex numbers, we see that the effect of the linear
mapping f (z) = az + b is to rotate by the fixed angle arg a, dilate by the factor |a|,
and then translate by b. (Note that the rotation and dilation commute, so it does not
matter which one we apply first. But we cannot change the order of the translation;

it comes last.) In particular, if γ1 and γ2 are two smooth paths that intersect at angle α at z0 , then their images under f are two paths in the w-plane that intersect at
w0 = f (z0 ); since f (z) has rotated each curve by the same angle arg a, the angle of
their intersection in the w-plane is still α . Furthermore, this mapping preserves the
orientation of γ1 (as being either clockwise or counterclockwise) with respect to γ2
(Figure 7.3). With this example in mind, we introduce the following definition.
Definition 7.1.1. A mapping defined in a neighborhood of a point z0 is said to be
conformal at z0 if it preserves the magnitude and the orientation of the angles between curves intersecting at z0 .
Now suppose that f is analytic at z0 and f  (z0 ) = 0. Then f is defined and is
analytic in a neighborhood of z0 , and from the study of the derivative in Section 2.3
we know that f is approximately linear in a neighborhood of z0 . More precisely, for
z near z0 we have
f (z) = f (z0 ) + f  (z0 )(z − z0 ) + ε (z)(z − z0 ),
where ε (z) → 0 as z → z0 . So, near z0 , we can write f (z) ≈ f  (z0 )z + b, where
b = − f  (z0 )z0 + f (z0 ) is a constant. From what we just discovered about linear
mappings, this suggests that f is conformal at z0 ; it rotates by an angle θ = arg f  (z0 )
and scales by a factor | f  (z0 )|. Indeed, we have the following important result.
Theorem 7.1.2. (Conformal Property) Suppose that f is analytic in a neighborhood of a point z0 in C and suppose that f  (z0 ) = 0. Then f is conformal at z0 .
Proof. Let γ be a smooth path through z0 , parametrized by γ (t) = x(t) + i y(t), with
γ (t0 ) = z0 and γ  (t0 ) = 0. Then the image of γ by f is a path parametrized by f (γ (t))
that passes through w0 = f (z0 ) in the w-plane. Since γ  (t0 ) = 0, the direction
 of
the tangent line to γ at z0 is arg γ  (t0 ). Also, from the chain rule, dtd f (γ (t))t =
0
f  (γ (t0 ))γ  (t0 ) = 0 and the direction of the tangent line to f ◦ γ at w0 = f (z0 ) is

It follows that

arg( f ◦ γ ) (t0 ) − arg γ  (t0 ) = arg f  (z0 ),

and consequently
arg( f ◦ γ1 ) (t0 ) − arg( f ◦ γ2 ) (t0 ) = arg γ1 (t0 ) − arg γ2 (t0 )
for any two curves with γ1 (t0 ) = z0 = γ2 (t0 ) and γ1 (t0 ) = 0 = γ2 (t0 ). Thus the oriented angle of intersection between two tangent lines of curves intersecting at z0 is
the same as that for the images of these curves under the mapping f . This proves
that f is a conformal mapping.

7 Conformal Mappings

Boundary Behavior
We use conformal mappings to transform boundary value problems consisting of
Laplace’s equation along with boundary conditions. To handle the effect of the
mapping on the boundary conditions, it would be nice to know that the boundary
is mapped to the boundary. But as the following simple example shows, this may
fail in general.

Example 7.1.3. (Boundary points mapped to interior points) Consider f (z) = z2
and Ω = {z = reiθ : 12 < r < 1, −π < θ < π }. Then f is analytic and f  (z) = 2z = 0
for all z in Ω . Hence f is conformal at each z in Ω . Since z2 = r2 e2iθ , it is easy to
see that f [Ω ] is the annulus
f [Ω ] = {w = reiθ : 14 < r < 1, −2π < θ < 2π } = {w = reiθ : 14 < r < 1, 0 ≤ θ ≤ 2π }.

Fig. 7.4 The function f (z) = is conformal in Ω . It takes the interval
(−1, − 21 ) on the boundary of Ω to the interval ( 41 , 1) in the interior of
f [Ω ]. Thus f does not map boundary points to boundary points.
z2

It is also easy to see that the boundary points z = x, −1 ≤ x ≤ − 12 are mapped
to the interior points w = u, 14 ≤ u ≤ 1 (see Figure 7.4). Thus f does not map the

boundary of Ω to the boundary of f [Ω ].
The condition f  (z) = 0 for all z in a region Ω ensures only that f is one-toone locally, and not necessarily one-to-one on the entire region; see Theorem 5.7.13
(Inverse Function Theorem) and Example 7.1.3. We show below that if f is analytic
and one-to-one, then it maps the boundary of its domain to the boundary of the
range. Before we do so, let us clarify certain issues. We know from Corollary 5.7.13
(Mapping of Regions) that if f is analytic and nonconstant on a region Ω , then f [Ω ]
is a region. So all the points in Ω are mapped to the open connected set f [Ω ]. Now
f might not be defined on the boundary of Ω , so we need a special definition to
describe how f maps the boundary of Ω .
Definition 7.1.4. Let f be a mapping from a region Ω to the complex plane.
(i) We say that f maps the boundary of Ω to the boundary of f [Ω ] if the following

7.1 Basic Properties

407

condition holds: If {zn }∞
n=1 is any sequence in Ω converging to α0 on the boundary
of Ω and β is any point in f [Ω ], then { f (zn )}∞
n=1 does not converge to β . So if
converges,
it
must
converge
to
a
boundary
point of f [Ω ] or to infinity.
{ f (zn )}∞
n=1
If the region Ω is unbounded, we allow α0 to be ∞.
(ii) We say that f maps the boundary of Ω onto the boundary of f [Ω ] if f maps
the boundary of Ω to the boundary of f [Ω ] and, additionally, for every point w0 on
the boundary of f [Ω ] there is a sequence zn in Ω with zn → α0 , α0 being on the
boundary of Ω such that f (zn ) → w0 .
∞
There are examples where { f (zn )}∞
n=1 does not converge where {zn }n=1 converges to a point on the boundary of a region; see Exercise 19.

Theorem 7.1.5. (Boundary Behavior) Suppose that f is analytic and one-to-one
on a region Ω . Then f maps the boundary of Ω onto the boundary of f [Ω ].
Proof. We first prove that f maps the boundary of Ω to the boundary of f [Ω ]. Since
f is one-to-one, it is nonconstant and, in view of Corollary 5.7.15, f [Ω ] is a region.
Let β be a point of f [Ω ] and let {zn }∞
n=1 be a sequence in Ω such that f (zn ) → β .
Since f is analytic and one-to-one, f −1 exists and is analytic, and hence continuous.
Thus

so
converges to an interior point of Ω . Thus if {zn }∞
n=1 converges to a point
α0 on the boundary of Ω , then { f (zn )}∞
n=1 cannot converge to β .
We now turn to the “onto” assertion of the theorem. Let w0 be on the boundary
of f [Ω ]; then we can find points wn = f (zn ) such that zn is in Ω and wn → w0 . We
distinguish two cases. If the sequence {zn }∞
n=1 is unbounded, then a subsequence
{zn j }∞j=1 tends to ∞, which is a point on the boundary of Ω , and f (zn j ) → w0 .
If {zn }∞
n=1 is bounded, then by the Bolzano-Weierstrass property, we can find a
subsequence {zn j }∞j=1 that converges to a point α0 in the closure Ω of Ω . Notice
that if α0 were in Ω , then by the continuity of f we would have f (zn j ) → f (α0 ).
But since f (zn j ) → w0 , it would follow that f (α0 ) = w0 , which is a contradiction
since f (α0 ) lies in the region f [Ω ] while w0 lies on the boundary of f [Ω ]. Thus α0
lies on the boundary of Ω and the claim is proved.

If the conformal mapping can be extended to a continuous function on the boundary, the following version of Theorem 7.1.5 will be useful.
Corollary 7.1.6. Suppose that f is analytic and one-to-one in a region Ω . Suppose
that f extends continuously to the closure Ω . Then for any point α of the boundary
of Ω the point f (α ) lies on the boundary of f [Ω ].
Proof. Let {zn }∞
n=1 be a sequence in Ω converging to α on the boundary of Ω .
Since f is continuous at α , f (zn ) converges to f (α ). By Theorem 7.1.5, f maps the
boundary of Ω to the boundary of Ω , which means that f (zn ) does not converge to

an interior point of Ω . Thus f (α ) is a boundary point of f [Ω ].

7 Conformal Mappings

The fact that the boundary is mapped to the boundary helps determine the image
of a region from our knowledge of the image of the boundary and one interior point.
We illustrate this useful technique by revisiting Example 1.7.8.
Example 7.1.7. (Mapping of regions) Let Ω = {z = x + i y : − π2 < x < π2 , y > 0}
be the semi-infinite vertical strip shown in Figure 7.5. Let f (z) = sin z defined on
Ω . Since sin z1 = sin z2 if and only if z1 = z2 + 2kπ (k an integer), we see that f is
one-to-one on Ω . Also, f is continuous on the boundary of Ω .

Fig. 7.5 The fact that the boundary of f [Ω ] is the u-axis implies that f [Ω ] is
either the upper or lower half-plane. We decide which half it is by checking the
image of one point. Note how the right angles at z = ± π2 got flattened by f in the
w-plane. The function f is still conformal in Ω , even though f is not conformal at
two points on the boundary.

Solution. We start by determining the image of the boundary. For z = x real, we
have f (z) = sin x, and so f maps the interval − π2 ≤ x ≤ π2 onto the interval [−1, 1].
For z = π2 + iy, we have f (z) = sin( π2 + i y) = cosh y, which is a real number; see
(1.7.17). So f maps the vertical semi-infinite line z = π2 + iy (y ≥ 0) onto the semiinfinite interval [1, ∞). For z = − π2 + iy, we have f (z) = sin(− π2 + i y) = − cosh y;
see again (1.7.17). So f maps the vertical semi-infinite line z = − π2 + iy (y ≥ 0)
onto the semi-infinite interval (−∞, −1]. Thus, f maps the boundary of Ω to the
real axis. According to Theorem 7.1.5, the image of the vertical strip has boundary
the u-axis, so it is either the upper or the lower half-plane. Checking the value of f
at one point in Ω , say z = i, we find f (i) = sin(i) = i sinh(1), which is a point in the

upper half. Thus the image of Ω is the upper half-plane.
As a further application, we consider the Joukowski function
J(z) =

(z = 0).

(7.1.1)

This function has applications in aerospace engineering.

7.1 Basic Properties

upper unit semicircle) onto the real interval J[σ ] = [−1, 1] and also maps the semiinfinite intervals [1, ∞) and (−∞, −1] onto themselves.
(b) Show that the Joukowski function maps the set Ω = {z : |z| ≥ 1, 0 ≤ Arg z ≤ π }
onto the upper half-plane {w = u + i v : v ≥ 0} (see Figure 7.6). (A more precise
description of the Joukowski mapping is outlined in Exercise 17.)

As θ varies from 0 to π , w varies from 1 to −1, showing that the image of the
upper semicircle is the interval [−1, 1]. To determine the images of the semi-infinite
intervals [1, ∞) and (−∞, −1], let z = x; then J(z) = 12 (x + 1x ). As x varies through
[1, ∞) or (−∞, −1], J(x) varies through the same interval (in the w-plane).
(b) We showed in (a) that J maps the boundary of Ω onto the real axis. If we can
show that J is conformal and one-to-one, it will follow from Corollary 7.1.6 that
J[Ω ] is either the upper or the lower half of the w-plane. We can then determine
which half it is by checking the image
 of one
 point in Ω . That J is conformal at all
points in Ω is clear from J  (z) = 12 1 − z12 = 0 for all |z| > 1. To show that J is
one-to-one, let z1 , z2 be in Ω , and suppose that J(z1 ) = J(z2 ). Then
z1 +

⇒ z2 z21 + z2 − z1 z22 − z1 = 0
⇒ (z1 − z2 )(z1 z2 − 1) = 0.

So either z1 = z2 or z1 z2 = 1. Since 1 < |z1 | and 1 < |z2 |, we cannot have z1 z2 = 1.
So z1 = z2 , implying that J is one-to-one. We have J(2i) = 12 (2i + 2i1 ) = 3i4 . Since
J(2i) is in the upper half-plane, we conclude that J[Ω ] is the upper half-plane. 
As we observed after Example 7.1.3, the condition f  (z) = 0 for all z in a region
Ω is not enough to ensure that f is one-to-one on Ω . However, if f is analytic and
one-to-one on the whole region Ω , then f  (z) = 0 for all z in Ω , so f is a conformal

mapping. Moreover, from Section 5.7, we know that the inverse function exists on
Ω  = f [Ω ] and is analytic and one-to-one. In this situation, we say that Ω and Ω 
are conformally equivalent regions.
The following famous theorem of Riemann states that any simply connected region of the complex plane other than the plane itself is conformally equivalent to
the open unit disk.
Theorem 7.1.9. (Riemann Mapping Theorem) Let Ω be a simply connected region in the complex plane other than the complex plane itself. Then there is a oneto-one analytic function f that maps Ω onto the unit disk |w| < 1. The mapping f is
unique if we specify that f (z0 ) = 0 and f  (z0 ) > 0, for some z0 in Ω .
The proof of the Riemann mapping theorem extends beyond the scope of this
book. A proof of this theorem can be found in L. Ahlfors: Complex Analysis, 3rd
Ed., Inter. Ser. in Pure & Applied Math. McGraw-Hill Ed, 1979 or in J. Conway:
Functions of One Complex Variable I, GTM 11, 2nd Ed., Springer 1978.
In the next section we pursue the construction of important conformal mappings.
Some of these are then used to solve Dirichlet problems in general simply connected
domains by transforming the Dirichlet problem to the unit disk. This is achieved in
Section 7.3.

7.2 Linear Fractional Transformations
Our success in solving boundary value problems involving Laplace’s equation is
closely tied to our ability to construct conformal mappings between regions in the
plane. A good place to start our study of special conformal mappings is on the unit
disk, since there we have a general formula for the solution of the Dirichlet problem,
namely the Poisson integral formula. As we will soon see, the most suitable mappings for regions involving disks and lines are the linear fractional transformations:

φ (z) =

az + b
cz + d

(ad = bc).

(7.2.1)

ad−bc
Since φ  (z) = (cz+d)
2 , the condition ad = bc ensures that φ does not degenerate into
a constant. If c = 0, the linear fractional transformation reduces to a linear function,
which is analytic everywhere or entire. If c = 0, then φ is analytic for all z = − dc
and has a simple pole at z = − dc .

Proposition 7.2.1. Let φ be the linear fractional transformation defined in (7.2.1),
where a, b, c, d are complex numbers with c = 0 and ad = bc.
(i) Then φ has a pole z = − dc and is one-to-one and conformal on C \ {− dc }; its
range is C \ { ac }.
(ii) The inverse of φ is the linear fractional transformation ψ from C \ { ac } onto
C \ {− dc } defined by
dw−b
.
(7.2.2)
ψ (w) =
−c w + a
Proof. We have

φ  (z) =

ad − bc
= 0 for all
(cz + d)2

d
z = − .
c

Hence, by Theorem 7.1.2, the mapping is conformal at all z = − dc and obviously
it has a pole of order 1 at z = − dc . To find the inverse function, we solve w = az+b
cz+d
dw−b
for z = − dc and get z = −cw+a
for w = ac . Since φ has an inverse ψ , it must be
one-to-one, since φ (z1 ) = φ (z2 ), implies (ψ ◦ φ )(z1 ) = (ψ ◦ φ )(z2 ) i.e., z1 = z2 . 
It is not hard to see that every linear fractional transformation (7.2.1) with c = 0
is a composition of a linear mapping w1 = cz + d, of an inversion w2 = w11 , and of

412

7 Conformal Mappings

a linear mapping w = ac + (b − ad
c ) w2 (see Exercise 39). Now linear mappings have
a very useful property that is easy to verify: They map a line to a line and a circle
to a circle. The inversion w2 = w11 has a somewhat similar property: It maps the
collection of lines and circles in the z-plane to the collection of lines and circles in
the w-plane. (Unlike linear mappings, the inversion may map a line to a circle or a
circle to a line; see Figure 7.7.)

Fig. 7.7 The inversion f (z) = 1z preserves the collection of lines and circles. To verify the images of the given lines and circles, use the fact that f
is conformal (preserves angles) and the values f (0) = ∞; f (∞) = 0; f (1) = 1;
f (−1) = −1; f (i) = −i; f (−i) = i; f ( 43 ) = 43 .

This property of the inversion is a bit cumbersome to verify and is sketched in Exercises 33–39. Since a linear fractional transformation is a composition of linear
mappings and an inversion, it inherits this property too. Thus we obtain the following very useful result.
Proposition 7.2.2. (Images of Lines and Circles) A linear fractional transformation, as in (7.2.1), maps lines and circles to lines and circles.
It follows immediately from Proposition 7.2.1 and Theorem 7.1.5 that a linear
fractional transformation maps the boundary of its domain to boundary of its range.
As we now illustrate, this property is very useful in determining the image of a
region.
Example 7.2.3. (Mappings between the unit disk and the upper half-plane)
(a) Show that the linear fractional transformation

φ (z) = i

maps the unit disk onto the upper half-plane.
(b) Show that the linear fractional transformation

ψ (z) =

i+z

7.2 Linear Fractional Transformations

413

maps the upper half-plane onto the unit disk.
Solution. (a) By Proposition 7.2.2, the image of the circle C1 (0) is either a line or
a circle in the w-plane. Since three points will determine either a line or circle, it
suffices to check the images of three points on C1 (0). We have

φ (1) = 0;

φ (i) = i

1−i
= 1;
1+i

φ (−i) = i

1+i
= −1.
1−i

Thus φ (1), φ (i), and φ (−i) lie on the u-axis (the real axis in the w-plane), and so
the image of C1 (0) is the u-axis. As φ is one-to-one, it maps the boundary C1 (0)
onto the boundary of the image of the unit disk. Thus the image of the unit disk is
either the upper half-plane or the lower half-plane. Checking φ (0) = i (a point in the
upper half-plane), we conclude that φ maps the unit disk one-to-one onto the upper
half-plane (see Figure 7.8). Note also that since φ maps the closed unit disk to an
unbounded region (the upper half-plane), it has to be discontinuous somewhere in
the closed unit disk. Indeed it is singular at z = −1.

Fig. 7.8 The linear fractional transformation φ (z) = i 1−z
1+z maps the unit circle
to the real line and the unit open unit disk to the open upper half plane.

(b) We can do this part in two ways. One way is to use Proposition 7.2.1(ii) and
notice that ψ is the inverse of φ . Another way is to check the image by ψ of the
boundary and one interior point. We leave it as an exercise to verify that ψ (0) = 1,
ψ (1) = i, and ψ (−1) = −i. Since the images of the three points are not collinear,
we conclude that the real axis is mapped onto the circle that goes through the points
1, i, and −i, which is clearly the unit circle. (Here again, we are using the fact that
three points determine a circle.) Also, ψ (i) = 0; hence ψ maps the upper half-plane
onto the unit disk.

Another way to realize that the image of the unit circle is a line in Example 7.2.3(a) is to consider the point −1 on C1 (0) and note that limz→−1 φ (z) = ∞.
So the image of C1 (0) is not bounded and since it is either a line or a circle, it has
to be a line (which tends to infinity). Sometimes it is convenient to express the fact
that the limit at the point z0 = − dc is infinity by writing φ (z0 ) = ∞. Likewise, it will
a

be convenient to express that limz→∞ az+b
cz+d = c by simply writing φ (∞) = c .

7 Conformal Mappings

Before the next example we discuss another useful property of linear fractional
transformations.
Proposition 7.2.4. (Composition of Mappings) The composition of any two linear
fractional transformations is another linear fractional transformation.
Proof. Let

φ1 (z) =

a1 z + b1
c1 z + d1

φ2 (z) =

and

Then

φ (z) = (φ2 ◦ φ1 )(z) =

a2 z + b2
.
c2 z + d2

z+b1
a2 ac11z+d
+ b2
1
z+b1
c2 ac11z+d
+ d2

.

Multiplying numerator and denominator by c1 z + d1 , we get

φ (z) =

(a2 a1 + b2 c1 )z + a2 b1 + b2 d1
,
(c2 a1 + d2 c1 )z + c2 b1 + d2 d1

which is a linear fractional transformation. Notice that when we multiplied by the
quantity c1 z + d1 , we removed the singularity at z = − dc11 ; the resulting composition
φ (z) has a single pole, and it is not necessarily at the same location as the poles of
φ1 or φ2 .


Example 7.2.5. (Composition of linear fractional transformations) Find a linear
fractional transformation that maps the disk B2 (−1) with radius 2 and center at −1
onto the right half-plane Re w > 0.
Solution. We describe two methods to solve this problem. Let us start with the
quickest one based on the result of Example 7.2.3 and a simple application of Proposition 7.2.4. We know that
1−z
φ (z) = i
1+z
maps the unit disk onto the upper half-plane. It is also easy to see that the linear
mapping τ (z) = 12 (z + 1) translates the center of B2 (−1) to the origin and then
scales the radius by 12 . Thus τ maps B2 (−1) onto the unit disk. Consequently, φ ◦ τ
is a linear fractional transformation that maps B2 (−1) onto the upper half-plane.
To map onto the right half-plane, it suffices to rotate the upper half-plane by − π2 .
π
This can be achieved by multiplying by e−i 2 = −i. So the desired linear fractional
transformation (Figure 7.9) is
f (z) = −i φ ◦ τ (z) = (−i)i

1 − 12 (z + 1)
1 + 12 (z + 1)

Fig. 7.9 To map a disk to a half-plane, it is always advantageous to map first to the unit disk and
then use the transformation φ in Example 7.2.3.

Another way to go about this problem is to start from scratch; we want a linear fractional transformation g(z) = az+b
cz+d to map the boundary of the disk onto the
boundary of the right half-plane. We can pick any three points on the circle C and
map them to any three points on the imaginary axis. Since our image boundary is a
line (which extends to infinity), we may map one of our points to ∞. We pick
√
g(1) = 0, g(−3) = ∞, g(i 3) = i.
(7.2.3)
We use these equations to solve for the coefficients a, b, c, and d, and then we check
whether the interior of the disk is mapped to the right half-plane or the left halfget a = −b. From g(−3) = ∞
plane. Again writing g(z) = az+b
cz+d , from g(1) = 0 we√
az−a
we get 3c = d. Thus g(z) = cz+3c
= ac z−1
.
From
g(i
3) = i we obtain

⇒ =i

c i 3+3

Then g(z) = 3 z−1
z+3 will map the circle C onto the y-axis. Note that any function of
the form α g, where α = 0 is real, will also map the circle C onto the y-axis, since
multiplying by a nonzero real √
constant leaves a line through the origin unchanged.
So for simplicity we divide by 3, still calling the function g, and obtain a mapping
g(z) = z−1
z+3 of the circle C onto the y-axis. Does g(z) take the region inside C onto
the right half-plane? We check the image of one point inside C, say −1, and find
g(−1) = −2
2 = −1, which is a point in the left half-plane. So we modify g by multiplying it by −1 and obtain the desired linear fractional transformation g(z) = 1−z
3+z .
As positive multiples of g also work, the solution to this problem is not unique. 
The previous examples illustrate how a linear fractional transformation can be
determined from the images of three distinct points. In fact, we have the following
useful formula.
Proposition 7.2.6. There is a unique linear fractional transformation w = φ (z) that
maps three distinct points z1 , z2 , and z3 onto three distinct points w1 , w2 , and w3 .
The mapping w is implicitly given by
w − w1 w2 − w3
z − z1 z2 − z 3
=
.
z − z3 z2 − z1
w − w3 w2 − w1

(7.2.4)

7 Conformal Mappings

Proof. That w is a linear fractional transformation follows by solving for w in
(7.2.4). To see that w maps z j to w j (j=1, 2, 3) it suffices to note that (7.2.4) holds
if we replace z by z j and w by w j . (For j = 3, you must take reciprocals in (7.2.4)
before replacing z by z3 and w by w3 .) The uniqueness part is delegated to Exercises 9–10.

Mapping a circle onto a line by a linear fractional transformation, as we saw in
Example 7.2.5, can be achieved by requiring that f (z) = ∞ for some z on the circle.
In this case, the formula in Proposition 7.2.6 can be simplified as follows. Say we
2 /w3
2 −w3
= 1−w
want f (z3 ) = ∞. As w3 → ∞, the fraction ww−w
1−w/w → 1. This suggests that
3
3

2 −w3
= 1 on the right side of (7.2.4), obtaining the formula, stated in the
we set ww−w
3
following proposition, whose verification is left to Exercise 11.

Proposition 7.2.7. (Mapping to a point at infinity) Let z1 , z2 , and z3 be three distinct points. There is a unique linear fractional transformation w = φ (z) that maps
z1 and z2 onto two distinct points w1 and w2 and maps z3 to ∞. The mapping w is
implicitly given by
z − z1 z 2 − z 3
w − w1
=
.
(7.2.5)
z − z3 z2 − z1
w2 − w1
There is also a corresponding identity for a linear fractional transformation mapping ∞ to a point, obtained by reversing the roles of z and w in (7.2.5) (see Exercise 11). Our next example uses the conformal property of linear fractional transformations.

Example 7.2.8. (Mapping of a lens-shaped region) The lens-shaped region Ω in
Figure 7.10 is bounded by the arcs of two circles.
(a) Use a linear fractional transformay
tion φ to map Ω onto a sector in the
w-plane in such a way that

φ (−2) = 0
φ (−i) = 1
φ (2) = ∞

circles at the point −2.

(b) Of course we can determine the angle between C1 and C2 by finding their equations, then the slopes of the tangent lines at −2, and then the angle between the
tangent lines. A better way is to calculate the angle between the images of C1 and
C2 and use the conformal property of φ . As φ maps lines and circles to lines and
circles, it is clear from its action on the points −2, −i, and 2 that φ maps the circle
C1 onto the u-axis. It also maps the circle C2 onto a line that goes through the point
φ (−2) = 0. To determine this line, it suffices to check the image of another point
on C2 . We have φ ( 23 i) = i. Thus φ maps C2 onto the v-axis. Since φ is conformal
at z = −2, it preserves the angles at this point. Thus, the angle between the circles
at z = −2 is equal to the angle between their images, the u- and v-axes, which is

clearly π2 .
Some applications concerning the electrostatic potential inside a capacitor formed
by two cylinders lead to Dirichlet problems in regions bounded by two circles in the
plane, which are not necessarily concentric. The problems are easier to solve when
the two circles are concentric, giving rise to an annular region. Thus there is a great
advantage in using a conformal mapping to center the circles before solving the
Dirichlet problem. In what follows, we use a specific example to illustrate this process. More general examples are presented in the exercises.

Solution. The idea is to use one of the linear fractional transformations

φα (z) =

z−α
,
1 − αz

(7.2.6)

where α is a complex number such that |α | < 1. According to Proposition 4.6.2 we
have that φα maps the unit disk onto itself and the its boundary onto itself. Since φα
is a linear fractional transformation, it will map the circle C1 onto a circle or a line,
but because the image has to be inside the image of the unit disk, it follows that φ [C1 ]
is bounded and hence it must be a circle. We now ask the following question: Can
we find α so that φα [C1 ] is a circle centered at the origin? Suppose for a moment
that α were real. Then clearly φα (x) is also real, and so φα maps the real line to

418

7 Conformal Mappings

the real line. Note that φα (1/7) and φα (1/2) are the points where φα [C1 ] meets
the u-axis. Also, the circle φα [C1 ] must meet the u-axis in a perpendicular fashion
(Figure 7.12), for the following three reasons:
(i) C1 itself meets the real axis in a perpendicular fashion;
(ii) the x-axis is mapped to the u-axis; and
(iii) the map φα is conformal.

Fig. 7.12 For all |α | < 1, φα (z) maps the unit circle C2
onto itself. But for one special value of α , with |α | < 1,
φα will also map the circle C1 onto a circle centered at the
origin, thus centering the images of C1 and C2 .

So if we want φα [C1 ] to be a circle centered at the origin, it is enough to require that
φα (1/7) = −φα (1/2). This implies that

Composing Elementary Mappings
Our next goal is to compose elementary mappings studied thus far to construct nontrivial conformal mappings of regions in the plane. We provide four examples to
illustrate this process.

7.2 Linear Fractional Transformations

Example 7.2.10. (Mapping a lens onto a disk) Construct a sequence of analytic
functions that maps the lens-shaped region of Example 7.2.8 in a one-to-one way
onto the unit disk. Write down the mapping that results from your construction.
Solution. The first step is to use the function of Example 7.2.8,

2+z
2+i 2+z

where α =

which maps the lens to the first quadrant. The first quadrant is then mapped onto
the upper half-plane by the function w2 = w21 . (Note that our mapping is no longer
a linear fractional transformation.) Finally, the linear fractional transformation ψ in
Example 7.2.3(b) will take the upper half-plane onto the unit disk. Each of these
mappings is analytic and one-to-one on the region of interest. So the resulting function is analytic and one-to-one. The mapping is illustrated in Figure 7.13.

unit disk is

The first mapping w1 = − 1z , being conformal at z = i and z = 2i, preserves the
right angles at these points. Since it maps the imaginary axis onto the imaginary axis,
and 0 to ∞, consequently it will map the two circles onto two lines that intersect the
imaginary axis at right angle. Thus the images of the circles are parallel horizontal
lines as shown in Figure 7.15. As we move counterclockwise around the circles in
the z-plane, we move rightward on the lines in the w1 -plane. The mapping w2 =
2π (w1 − 2i ) translates and then scales the horizontal strip appropriately to set us up
for an exponential mapping to the upper half-plane.


Example 7.2.13. (Mapping the unit disk onto an infinite horizontal strip) We describe a sequence of analytic and one-to-one mappings that take the unit circle onto
an infinite horizontal strip. The first linear fractional transformation, w1 = −iφ (z),
is obtained by multiplying by −i the linear fractional transformation φ (z) in Example 7.2.3(i). Since φ (z) maps the unit disk onto the upper half-plane, and multiplication by −i rotates by the angle − π2 , the effect of −iφ (z) is to map the unit disk
onto the right half-plane.

25. Project Problem: Centering disks. We generalize the process in Example 7.2.9 to any region
bounded by two nonintersecting circles, C2 and C1 , such that C1 is in the interior of C2 .
By translating the center of C2 to the origin, scaling, and rotating, we can always reduce the picture to the one described in Figure 7.30, where |a| < b < 1, C2 is the unit
circle, and C1 is centered on the x-axis with
x-intercepts (a, 0) and (b, 0). We show that
we can choose α such that −1 < α < 1 and
φα maps C1 onto a circle centered at the origin. Here φα is the linear fractional transformation (7.2.6), which maps C2 onto C2 .
As explained in Example 7.2.9, it suffices to
choose α so that φα (a) = −φα (b).

30. A geometric problem. The following is an interesting illustration of the use of linear fractional
transformations to prove geometric facts. Consider
a circle C and a point z0 inside C (Figure 7.35). We
show that all the circles C through z0 that intersect
C at right angle also intersect at a common point z1
as in Figure 7.35. The point z1 is called the reflection of z0 in C. We also say that the points z0 and
z1 are symmetric with respect to the circle C.

7.3 Solving Dirichlet Problems with Conformal Mappings
In this section we use conformal mappings to solve Dirichlet problems. Very often the difficulty in solving Dirichlet problems is due to the geometry of the region on which the problem is stated. Conformal mappings can be used to transform

430

7 Conformal Mappings

a region to one on which the ensuing boundary value problem is easier to solve.
Roughly speaking, the conformal mapping provides the change of variables that
leaves Laplace’s equation unchanged but transforms the boundary conditions. At
the heart of the method lie the Riemann mapping theorem (Theorem 7.1.9) and the
invariance of Laplace’s equation by conformal mappings [identity 6.1.3].
To make things precise, let Ω be a simply connected region on the plane. Suppose
we have the Dirichlet problem

Δ u = 0 on Ω

u = b on ∂ Ω .

(7.3.1)

We fix a conformal map f from Ω onto another domain W = f [Ω ]. Then we consider the new Dirichlet problem

Δ U = 0 on W,

U = b ◦ f −1 on ∂ W.

(7.3.2)

Let U be a solution of the Dirichlet problem (7.3.2) on W . We claim that the function
u = U ◦ f solves the Dirichlet problem (7.3.1) on Ω . Indeed, the conformal mapping
transfers one boundary function into the other. Moreover, identity (6.1.3) yields

Δ u = Δ (U ◦ f ) = | f  |2 Δ U
and since f  is never vanishing, it follows that Δ u = 0 on Ω if and only if Δ U = 0 on
W . This method is illustrated in Figure 7.39 when W is the unit disk D. In practice
W could also be the upper half space or any other domain on which we know how
to solve a Dirichlet problem.

Fig. 7.39 A one-to-one conformal mapping f of Ω onto the unit
disk D = f [Ω ] takes boundary to boundary and preserves Laplace’s
equation. It transforms the conditions Δ u = 0 on Ω and u = b on
∂ Ω to Δ U = 0 on D and U = b ◦ f −1 on ∂ D. The solution of the
initial Dirichlet problem in Ω is then u(z) = U( f (z)).

This method turns out to be phenomenally powerful. Not only we will be able to
solve specific problems, but we can also take general formulas, such as the Poisson
integral formula on a disk, and produce similar formulas for the solution of Dirichlet
problems on new regions in the plane.
Recall that for Dirichlet problems where the boundary data is constant along
rays, we can find a solution using a branch of the argument. We denote by argα z
the branch of the argument with a branch cut at angle α , and by Arg z the principal

7.3 Solving Dirichlet Problems with Conformal Mappings

431

branch with a branch cut along the negative real axis. These functions, being the
imaginary parts of the corresponding logarithm branches, are harmonic everywhere
except on their branch cuts.
Recall also that a linear combination of harmonic functions with real scalars is
again a harmonic function (Proposition 6.1.4). For example, u(z) = 100
π (π − Arg z)
is harmonic in the upper half-plane with boundary values u(x) = 100 if x > 0 and
u(x) = 0 if x < 0. This solution to a very simple Dirichlet problem in the upper
half-plane helps us solve a somewhat difficult Dirichlet problem on the unit disk.
Example 7.3.1. (Steady-state temperature distribution in a disk) The boundary
of a circular plate of unit radius with insulated lateral surface is kept at a fixed
temperature distribution equal to 100◦ on the upper semicircle and 0◦ on the lower
semicircle (see Figure 7.40). Find the steady-state temperature inside the plate.
Solution. To answer this question, we must solve Δ u = 0 inside the unit disk with
boundary values u = 100 on the upper semicircle and u = 0 on the lower semicircle.
While the geometry of the circle makes it difficult to understand the effect of the
boundary conditions on the solution inside the unit disk, the corresponding boundary value problem in the upper half-plane has a simple solution. To transform the
original problem into a problem in the upper half-plane, we use the linear fractional
transformation φ (z) = i 1−z
1+z from Example 7.2.3(ii). It is easy to verify that φ takes
the upper semicircle onto the positive real axis, and the lower semicircle onto the
negative real axis. Thus φ transforms the given Dirichlet problem into a Dirichlet
problem in the upper half-plane with boundary values shown in Figure 7.41.

According to our preceding discussion, the solution in the upper half of the w-plane
is U(w) = 100
π (π − Arg w). By composing the solution in the w-plane with the conformal map, we get a solution of our original problem, u(z) = U(φ (z)), |z| < 1.
Hence the solution of the Dirichlet problem in the unit disk is

(π − Arg (i)) =

which is, as one might expect, the average value of the temperature on the circumference. With a little extra work, we can express the solution u(z) in terms of x and
y instead of z = x + i y, x, y real, (see Exercise 18).

We next solve a Dirichlet problem in a lens-shaped region.
Example 7.3.2. (Dirichlet problem in a lens-shaped region) Find a harmonic
function u in the lens-shaped region Ω in Figure 7.42, with boundary values u = 100
on the upper circular arc and u = 0 on the lower circular arc.
Solution. The region Ω was discussed in Example 7.2.8 from which we recall the
2+z
linear fractional transformation φ (z) = 2+i
2−i 2−z . It is straightforward to check that φ
maps the lower boundary of Ω onto the positive real axis, and the upper boundary
of Ω onto the positive imaginary axis. By checking the image of one point in Ω , say
1
z = 0, we find φ (0) = 2+i
2−i = 5 (3 + 4i), which is a point in the first quadrant. Thus φ
maps the region Ω onto the first quadrant and transforms the original problem into
a Dirichlet problem in the first quadrant of the w-plane, with boundary conditions
as shown in Figure 7.43.

For our next application, we recall the solution of the Dirichlet problem in an

of the boundary, respectively:

becomes
u(z) = T1 + (T1 − T2 )

As shown in Example 7.2.9, φ maps the unit circle C2 onto the unit circle, the inner
circle C1 onto a circle centered at the origin with radius 15 , and the region between
the unit circle and C2 onto the annular region 15 < |w| < 1. The boundary values in
the transformed problem are shown in Figure 7.46, and so according to (7.3.4) the
solution of the Dirichlet problem in the w-plane is

The table seems to confirm the solution that we found. The values of u are between

(inner and outer). Note also the symmetric property of u, due to the symmetries in
the problem: We have u(x + i y) = u(x − i y). You should expand the table of values
and make your own conclusions about the solution.

We next derive the Poisson formula in the upper half-plane using the corresponding formula in the unit disk.
Theorem 7.3.4. (Poisson Integral Formula in the Upper Half-plane) Let f be
a bounded piecewise smooth function on the real line. A solution of the Dirichlet
problem Δ u(x + i y) = 0 for x + i y in the upper half-plane (y > 0) with boundary
condition u(x) = f (x) for all −∞ < x < ∞ is given by the Poisson integral formula

(7.3.5)

Proof. We prove the first equality in (7.3.5); the second one follows by making the
change of variables s = x − s. Transform the problem into a Dirichlet problem in
the unit disk using the linear fractional transformation w = ψ (z) = i−z
i+z , z = x + i y,
y > 0 [Example 7.2.3(b)]. This mapping takes the real line onto the unit circle, and
the upper half-plane onto the unit disk. Denote the image of a point s on the real line
by eiφ on the unit circle, so eiφ = ψ (s).

As illustrated in Figure 7.47, the boundary data that we get for the problem on the
unit disk is U(eiφ ) = f (ψ −1 (eiφ )), for all eiφ on the unit circle. The solution of the
Dirichlet problem in the unit disk (|w| < 1) with this boundary data is obtained from

but a little tedious. Make the change of variables s = ψ −1 (eiφ ). Since the integrand
in (7.3.7) is 2π -periodic, we get the same result if we integrate from −π to π instead
of 0 to 2π , and as φ runs from −π to π , s runs from −∞ to ∞. We have
s = ψ −1 (eiφ ) ⇒ ψ (s) =

where α (x + i y) is the harmonic measure of the interval (a, b); that is, α is

Suppose that Ω is a region, f1 and f2 are two functions defined on the boundary
of Ω , and u1 and u2 are solutions of the Dirichlet problems on Ω with boundary values f1 and f2 , respectively. Since Laplace’s equation Δ u = 0 is linear, it is straightforward to check that u = u1 + u2 solves the Dirichlet problem on Ω with boundary
values u = f1 + f2 on the boundary of Ω . This useful process of generating a solution by adding solutions of two or more related problems is called superposition of
solutions. It will appear again in our study of other linear equations.
Example 7.3.7. (Superposing solutions) Let (a1 , b1 ) and (a2 , b2 ) be two disjoint
intervals on the real line, and let T1 and T2 be two complex numbers. Solve
the Dirichlet problem in the upper half-plane with boundary data f (x) = T1 if
x ∈ (a1 , b1 ), T2 if x ∈ (a2 , b2 ) and 0 otherwise.
Solution. For j = 1, 2, let f j (x) = T j if x is in (a j , b j ), 0 otherwise. Clearly, f (x) =
f1 (x) + f2 (x). From Example 7.3.6, the solution of the Dirichlet problem in the
upper half-plane with boundary values f j (x) on the real line is
u j (z) =

This problem models the steady-state distribution in a large sheet of metal with
insulated lateral surface, whose boundary along the x-axis is kept at a fixed temperature distribution described by a Poisson kernel Pa (x),where a > 0 is a positive
constant. The temperature at the origin is u(0) = Pa (0) =

2 1
π a , which tends to ∞ as
to 0 like a/(x2 + a2 ). So

a tends to 0. Away from the origin, the temperature decays
smaller values of a > 0 correspond to temperature distributions concentrated around
0. This fact is shown in Figure 7.51.
Solution. We apply the first formula in (7.3.5) and get for −∞ < x < ∞, y > 0,

7.4 The Schwarz-Christoffel Transformation
In this section we describe a method for constructing one-to-one analytic mappings
of the upper half-plane onto polygonal regions. We start by setting the notation.
Suppose that Ω is a region in the w-plane, bounded by a positively oriented
polygonal path P with n sides. Let w1 , w2 , . . . , wn denote the vertices of P, counted
consecutively as we trace the path through its positive orientation; see Figure 7.74

444

7 Conformal Mappings

when n = 5. If P is bounded, then the point wn is taken to be the initial and terminal
point of the closed path P. If P is unbounded, we take wn = ∞ and think of P as a
polygon with n − 1 vertices w1 , w2 , . . . , wn−1 (Figure 7.75). It will be convenient to
measure the exterior angle at a vertex, and so we let θ j denote the angle that we make
as we turn the corner of the polygon at w j . We choose 0 < |θ j | < π ( j = 1, . . . , n); a
positive value corresponds to a left turn, and a negative value corresponds to a right
turn. In Figure 7.74, θ2 is negative while all other θ j are positive.

Fig. 7.74 Positively oriented
polygonal boundary with corner angles measured from the
outside.

Fig. 7.75 Unbounded polygonal
region with n sides (n = 4) and
n − 1 vertices.

Theorem 7.4.1. (Schwarz-Christoffel Transformation) Let Ω be a region
bounded by a polygonal path P with vertices at w j (counted consecutively) and
corresponding exterior angles θ j . Then there is a one-to-one conformal mapping f
of the upper half-plane onto Ω , such that

(7.4.1)

where A is a constant, the x j ’s are real and satisfy x1 < x2 < · · · < xn−1 , f (x j ) = w j ,
limz→∞ f (z) = wn , and the complex powers are defined by their principal branches.
The points x j ( j = 1, . . . , n − 1) on the x-axis are the pre-images of the vertices
of the polygonal path P in the w-plane. Two of the x j ’s may be chosen arbitrarily, so long as they are arranged in ascending order. We can express the fact that
limz→∞ f (z) = wn by writing f (∞) = wn . In the case of an unbounded polygon P,
we have f (∞) = ∞.
Definition 7.4.2. The mapping f whose derivative is the function in (7.4.1) is called
a Schwarz-Christoffel transformation, after the German mathematicians Karl
Herman Amandus Schwarz (1843–1921) and Elwin Bruno Christoffel (1829–1900).
Since f is an antiderivative of the function in (7.4.1), we can write

7.4 The Schwarz-Christoffel Transformation

The constants A and B depend on the size and location of the polygonal path P.
The full proof of Theorem 7.4.1 is quite complicated. We only sketch a part of
the proof that illustrates the ideas behind the construction of the transformation.
Proof. (Sketch) Consider a mapping f whose derivative is given by (7.4.1), and let
w j denote the image of x j , where x1 < x2 < · · · < xn−1 are real. To understand the
effect of the mapping f on the real axis, recall from Section 7.1 that a conformal
mapping f at a point z0 acts like a rotation by an angle arg f  (z0 ). Thus the mapping
whose derivative is in (7.4.1) acts like a rotation by an angle
arg f  (z) =

π
For z = x on the x-axis with x < x1 , we have x − x j < 0 for all j = 1, 2, . . . , n − 1,
hence arg(x − x j ) = π for all j = 1, 2, . . . , n − 1, and so from (7.4.3) we get
−∞ < x < x1 , f (x) ∈ [wn , w1 ] =⇒ arg f  (x) = arg A − (θ1 +θ2 +· · ·+θn−1 ). (7.4.4)
Thus if wn = f (∞), then all the points in the interval (−∞, x1 ) are mapped onto a
line segment starting with wn and ending with w1 = f (x1 ) and at an angle given
by (7.4.4) (Figure 7.76). For x in the interval (x1 , x2 ), we have x − x1 > 0 and x −
x j < 0 for all j = 2, . . . , n − 1, hence arg(x − x1 ) = 0 and arg(x − x j ) = π for all
j = 2, . . . , n − 1, and so from (7.4.3) we obtain
x1 < x < x2 , f (x) ∈ [w1 , w2 ] =⇒ arg f  (x) = arg A − (θ2 + · · · + θn−1 ) .

Fig. 7.77 As x crosses x j from
left to right, arg f  (x) changes
abruptly by θ j then remains constant until it crosses x j+1 .

Thus, at x1 we have an abrupt change in the argument (the path turns left by angle θ1 )
and then all the points in (x1 , x2 ) are mapped onto the line segment with initial point
w1 and terminal point w2 = f (x2 ), and at an angle given by (7.4.5) (Figure 7.77).
Continuing in this fashion we obtain for j = 2, . . . , n − 1

446

7 Conformal Mappings

x j−1 < x < x j , f (x) ∈ [w j−1 , w j ] =⇒ arg f  (x) = arg A − (θ j + · · · + θn−1 ) . (7.4.6)
Finally we find that after an abrupt change in the argument, the points in the interval
(xn−1 , ∞) are mapped onto a line segment with initial point wn−1 , and at angle
xn−1 < x < +∞, f (x) ∈ [wn−1 , wn ] =⇒ arg f  (x) = arg A.

(7.4.7)

In the case of a bounded polygon, this line segment will connect back to wn (Exercise 11). The polygon is then closed; for closed polygons, after turning the last
corner our combined angle of turns is θ1 + θ2 + · · · + θn = 2π . Thus we have shown
that the mapping whose derivative is given by (7.4.1) takes the real line onto a polygon with vertices w j = f (x j ) and exterior angles θ j . Since the upper half-plane is to
our left as we traverse the real line rightward, conformality ensures that the image
region is to our left as we trace P in the positive sense (i.e., f maps the upper halfplane onto the interior of P). The converse of these statements is also true, although
we will not prove it. That is, for every polygonal path P with vertices w j and exterior angles θ j , it can be shown that we can find ordered real numbers x1 , . . . , xn−1 ,
and complex numbers A and B such that the mapping in (7.4.2) whose derivative is
given by (7.4.1) takes the real line onto P. Moreover, two of the x j ’s can be chosen
arbitrarily.

Example 7.4.3. (Schwarz-Christoffel transformation for a sector) Find a
Schwarz-Christoffel transformation that maps the upper half-plane onto the sector
of angle 0 < α < π shown in Figure 7.78.
Solution. Obviously one answer is
α
f (z) = z π , but let us see how this answer comes out of (7.4.2). Since the
region has two sides, we have n = 2.
From Figure 7.78, the exterior angle
at w1 = 0 is π − α . In the z-plane,
choose x1 = 0, then (7.4.2) yields

Solution. We know that sin z maps the
infinite strip in Figure 7.79 onto the
upper half-plane. So the mapping that
we are looking for is the inverse of
sin z. Let us see how this comes out of
(7.4.2). In the w-plane, take w1 = − π2 ,
w2 = π2 , with exterior angles θ1 =

Like many constructions involving Schwarz-Christoffel transformations, the next
example gives rise to elliptic integrals (see Section 5.5). Although these integrals
are very difficult to evaluate, they are extensively tabulated and can be conveniently
evaluated numerically using standard functions in most computer systems.

Schwarz-Christoffel transformation that maps the upper half-plane onto the right
isosceles triangle in Figure 7.80.
Solution. It is clear that the triangle is
determined by two consecutive vertices
and their corresponding angles. In the wplane, take w1 = −1, w2 = 1, with exterior angles θ1 = θ2 = 34π . In the z-plane,
we freely choose the points x1 = −1 and
x2 = 1. Then (7.4.2) yields

Example 7.4.6. (An L-shaped region) Find a Schwarz-Christoffel transformation
that maps the upper half-plane onto the L-shaped region in Figure 7.81.
Solution. To determine the orientation of the boundary in such a way that the region
becomes interior to a positively oriented boundary, we think of the region as a limit
of a region with vertices at w1 = 0, w2 > 0, and w3 = 1 + i, and corresponding
exterior angles θ1 = π2 , θ2 = α , and θ3 = β (Figure 7.82).

Fig. 7.82 The region in Figure 7.81 is thought of as the limit

As w2 → ∞, θ2 → π , and θ3 → − π2 . Thus, we may think of our region as having a
vertex at infinity with exterior angle θ2 = π and a vertex at w3 = 1 + i with exterior
angle − π2 . In fact, setting θ j = π forces f (x j ) = ∞. Now we may only choose two
of the three x j ’s arbitrarily, but in fact a solution can be found in x1 = −1, x2 = 0,
and x3 = 1. Other choices of the three x j ’s will typically result in other L-shaped
regions. From (7.4.2) and (7.4.9) (noticing that Im z < 0 in our case) we obtain
f (z) = A

Solution. To define the region as the interior of a positively oriented boundary requires four sides as shown in Figure 7.83. We think of the region as a limit of a
region with vertices at w1 = i, w2 = t (where t < 0) and w3 = −i, and corresponding
exterior angles θ1 = α , θ2 = β , and θ3 = α (Figure 7.84). As t → −∞, θ1 → −π ,

θ2 → π , and θ3 → −π . Thus, we may think of our region as having a vertex at

Image of Level Curves
Suppose that f is a Schwarz-Christoffel transformation taking the upper half-plane
onto a region Ω in the w-plane. If we want to solve a Dirichlet problem Δ U(w) = 0,
the technique is to map the problem to a corresponding problem in the upper half
of the z-plane, where a solution u of Laplace’s equation Δ u(z) = 0 with boundary
conditions can be obtained more easily. The solution in the w-plane is then U(w) =
u( f −1 (w)). However, the Schwarz-Christoffel transformation yields f , not f −1 , and
it is not always possible or easy to invert f in closed form; try for instance the
preceding examples. Nevertheless, the conformal map f is still very useful: It allows
us to find isotherms of U without actually knowing it. As we now show, this is
because the image under f of an isotherm u(z) = C (where C is a constant) is an
isotherm U(w) = C in the region Ω .
Proposition 7.4.8. (Image of Level Curves) With the preceding notation, the image
under w = f (z) of the level curve u(z) = C is a level curve U(w) = C. Thus, if γ (t),
a < t < b, parametrizes an isotherm of u, then f (γ (t)), a < t < b, parametrizes a
corresponding isotherm of U.
Proof. Since γ (t) is a level curve of u, u(γ (t)) = C. As U(w) = u( f −1 (w)), we
conclude that U( f (γ (t))) = u(γ (t)) = C, and hence f (γ (t)) is a level curve of U. 
This proposition is of course true for any one-to-one conformal map, not just for
Schwarz-Christoffel transformations acting on the upper half-plane. We illustrate
with an example.

Example 7.4.9. (Isotherms in the L-shaped region) Find the isotherms of the
Dirichlet problem Δ U(w) = 0 in the L-shaped region in Figure 7.85.

Fig. 7.85 The Dirichlet problem
on an L-shaped region.

Fig. 7.86 Isotherms for the
Dirichlet problem on an Lshaped region.

Solution. From Example 7.4.6, we know that the Schwarz-Christoffel transformation f (z) = π1 sin−1 z + i sin−1 1z + 1+i
2 maps the upper half-plane onto the Lshaped region. Since the boundary data switches from 0 to 100 at f (1) = 1 + i,
the corresponding Dirichlet problem in the upper half-plane is Δ u = 0, u(x) = 0 for
x < 1, and u(x) = 100 for x > 1. We immediately write down the solution using the
argument function:

Fluid Flow
We now investigate problems in two-dimensional fluid flow, using our knowledge of
harmonic functions and the technique of conformal mappings. In an ideal situation
where fluid is flowing over a two-dimensional surface represented by an unbounded
region Ω in the z-plane, assuming that the fluid is incompressible (fixed density)
and irrotational (circulation around a closed path is zero), it can be shown that there
is a harmonic function φ such that the velocity V in Ω is described by the gradient

of φ . That is, for (x, y) in Ω we have

(7.4.12)

Definition 7.4.10. The function φ is called the velocity potential of the flow. The
curves defined by the relation
φ (x, y) = C1
(7.4.13)
are called the equipotential curves or equipotential lines. The streamlines of the
flow are the curves that are orthogonal to the equipotential curves. If the streamlines
are expressed in the form
ψ (x, y) = C2 ,
(7.4.14)
for some function ψ , then, from Section 2.5, we know that we can take ψ to be the
harmonic conjugate of φ in Ω . The function ψ is called the stream function. The
fluid will flow on the level curves of ψ . If we let

Φ (z) = φ (x, y) + i ψ (x, y) (z = x + i y in Ω ),

(7.4.15)

then Φ is analytic in Ω . It is called the complex potential of the flow.
Thus the real part of the complex potential is the velocity potential, and the level
curves of its imaginary part are the streamlines. If Γ denotes the boundary of Ω , we
would expect the fluid to flow along Γ or that Γ is one of the streamlines. Thus the
points on Γ should satisfy (7.4.14).
For a simple example of a complex potential, we consider a uniform
rightward flow in the upper half-plane
y
with complex potential Φ (z) = z =
x + i y (Figure 7.87). Here the velocity potential is φ (x, y) = x, and
the velocity at each point is the vector (1, 0), which is the gradient of
x
φ (x, y) = x. The stream function is
ψ (x, y) = y, and the streamlines are
ψ (x, y) = C for constants C ≥ 0. In
accordance with the properties of a
Fig. 7.87 Streamlines in a uniform
flow, the boundary y = 0 is one of
rightward flow in the upper halfthe streamlines corresponding to the
plane.
value C = 0.
We find the streamlines using conformal mapping techniques. Let f be a one-toone conformal mapping of the upper half of the z-plane onto Ω , taking the x-axis
onto Γ , the boundary of Ω . Suppose that a stream function ψ is known for the upper
half-plane. By the properties of conformal mappings, Ψ = ψ ◦ f −1 is harmonic in
Ω . Proposition 7.4.8 tells us that the images of streamlines ψ (z) = C under the

454

7 Conformal Mappings

mapping f are streamlines Ψ (w) = C. Since the real axis is a streamline for ψ and
Γ is the image of the real axis, we conclude that Γ is a streamline for Ψ . Thus Ψ is
a stream function for Ω .
In the following examples, we take the simple stream function ψ (z) = y for the
upper half-plane. Streamlines for the region Ω are found by using Proposition 7.4.8.
Example 7.4.11. (Fluid flow in a sector) Find and plot the streamlines for the sector in Figure 15, where fluid flows in along the line Arg w = π4 and flows out along
Arg w = 0.
Solution. From Example 7.4.3, the
Schwarz-Christoffel
transformation
1
f (z) = z 4 maps the upper half-plane
to the sector 0 < arg z < π4 . We use the
simple stream function in the upper
half-plane ψ (z) = y to generate a
solution. Streamlines in the z-plane
are parametrized as γ (x) = x + i y0 for
fixed y0 . Streamlines in the w-plane
are images of these under f ; we have
1
f (γ (x)) = (x + i y0 ) 4 . As the parameter
x increases, the streamlines are traced
in the manner shown in Figure 7.88.
Fig. 7.88 Streamlines in a sector.
Fluid comes in along Arg w = π4 and
out along Arg w = 0.


Example 7.4.12. (Fluid flow in the doubly slit plane) Find and plot the streamlines
for the doubly slit plane in Figure 7.83, where fluid flows in from the upper left, past
the double obstacle, and flows out to the lower left.
Solution. In Example 7.4.7, we found
that f (z) = − π1 z2 + π2 Log z + π1 − i
y
is a conformal mapping of the upper
half-plane onto the doubly slit plane
Ω . Taking ψ (z) = y to be the stream

function for the upper half-plane, for
each y0 ≥ 0 we have a streamline
x
parametrized by

γ (x) = x + i y0 ,

−∞ < x < ∞.

By Proposition 7.4.8, the curves
f (γ (x)), −∞ < x < ∞, are streamlines
in the doubly slit plane. They are

do not affect convergence of f (z) or closure of the polygon, so we take A = 1 and B = 0. For

so | f (Reiθ ) − f (R)| → 0 uniformly in θ as R → ∞. Since f (R) → wn , we conclude that f (z) → wn
as z → ∞. A similar argument works if z lies in the lower half-plane, i.e., when π < θ ≤ 2π .

z, Arg (z − a) = Arg (a − z) ± π . However, 0 < Arg (z − a) < π and −π < Arg (a − z) < 0, so
0 < Arg (z − a) − Arg (a − z) < 2π and we must use the plus sign. This proves (7.4.16).

and so we must show (a − z) π (a + z) π = (a2 − z2 ) π . It is sufficient to show that
Arg (a − z) + Arg (a + z) = Arg (a2 − z2 ).
We know that for each z, Arg (a − z) + Arg (a + z) = Arg (a2 − z2 ) + 2kπ , where k is 0, 1, or −1.
However −π < Arg (a − z) < 0 and 0 < Arg (a + z) < π , so the left side is in (−π , π ), and hence
k = 0.

or that h(ζ ) = 2 Arg ζ + Arg (1− ζ12 )+ π − Arg (1− ζ 2 ) = 0. We know that h(ζ ) = 2kπ , where k is

an integer that may depend on ζ . However, since the images under w1 = 1 − ζ12 and w2 = 1 − ζ 2 of
the lower half-plane Im ζ < 0 do not include the negative real axis, h is continuous. A continuous
function which takes on discrete values must be constant (Lemma 5.7.8), and so k cannot depend
on ζ . Pick ζ = −i and conclude k = 0.

12. Project Problem: (Channel width
formula). We can write the logarithm as a Schwarz
Christoffel transformation Log z = dzz , where there is one vertex, x1 = 0, θ1 = π , w1 = ∞.
The selection of θ1 = π forces a semiinfinite channel in the left half-plane (in this
case the channel is also infinite into the right
half-plane). For points Δ x on the real axis
near x1 = 0, we have
f (Δ x) − f (−Δ x) = −iπ ,
and so the channel width is π . We now see
that this type of behavior is exhibited wherever we set an angle θ j0 = π .

θ j ≤ π . Then

u(ζ ) = f (ζ ) for ζ on Γ . (7.5.2)
Our goal in this section is to derive a
formula that expresses the solution as a
path integral over Γ , involving the boundary function f and the so-called Green’s
function of the region Ω , which is a function that depends only on Ω .

Suppose that Ω and Ω  are two regions bounded by simple paths Γ and Γ  . Let
φ be a one-to-one analytic map of Ω onto Ω  . We will further suppose that φ is analytic and one-to-one on Γ . It follows from Theorem 7.1.5 that φ maps the boundary
of Ω to the boundary of Ω  . Suppose that F is a real differentiable function of two
variables defined on Γ  . We think of complex numbers as points in the complex
plane, and consider F(z) for z on Γ  . We write ∂∂nF  or simply ∂∂Fn to denote the
Γ
directional derivative of F in the direction of the outward unit normal vector to the
path Γ  . By definition, this is the dot product of the gradient of F, ∇F = (Fx , Fy ),
with the outward unit normal vector nΓ . Thus

∂F
= ∇F · nΓ  ,
∂ nΓ 
where each expression is computed at a given point on Γ  ; see Figure 7.98.

Although normal derivatives are tedious

Our goal is to relate the normal derivative of F on Γ  to the normal derivative of
F ◦ φ on Γ . Recall that if φ is analytic and |φ  (z)| = 0 at some point z, then φ rotates
a path through z by a fixed angle and scales by |φ  (z)|. So φ maps a normal vector to
Γ at ζ to a normal vector to Γ  at φ (ζ ), and it scales its modulus by |φ  (ζ )|. Since
the normal derivative measures the rate of change of the function in the direction
of the normal vector to the curve, thinking as we do with the chain rule, we expect
the normal derivative of F ◦ φ at ζ to be equal to the normal derivative of F at φ (ζ )
times |φ  (ζ )|. This expectation turns out to be correct, and we have the following
change of variables formula:

∂ (F ◦ φ )

(7.5.3)

The proof of (7.5.3) is presented at the end of this section. The importance of this
formula is that it incorporates the effect of the conformal properties of analytic functions. Let us move a step closer to the desired formula for Green’s functions by deriving a formula that uses the boundary values of u to reproduce its value at a special
point inside Ω .

Lemma 7.5.1. (Change of Variables) Suppose that w = φ (z) is a one-to-one analytic mapping of a simply connected region Ω and its boundary Γ onto the open
unit disk D and its boundary C. Let u be a function harmonic on Ω and piecewise
continuous on the boundary Γ . Let z0 in Ω be the point such that φ (z0 ) = 0. Then

Fig. 7.100 If φ is analytic and one-to-one, then φ −1 is also analytic.

The function φ −1 is analytic from the closed unit disk (in the w-plane) onto Ω and
its boundary (in the z-plane). So the function u ◦ φ −1 is harmonic on the open unit
disk, being the composition of a harmonic function u with an analytic function φ −1
(Theorem 6.1.10). Moreover, u ◦ φ −1 is piecewise continuous on C. Thus, by the
mean value property of harmonic functions (Corollary 6.1.19), we have

Our goal now is to show that the integral in (7.5.4) is precisely the integral that
we just evaluated in (7.5.5). Parametrize C by eit , 0 ≤ t ≤ 2π . Then Γ will be

Composing φ with an appropriate linear fractional transformation, we are able to
reproduce the values of u at any point inside Ω , not just z0 = φ −1 (0) as shown in
(7.5.4). Let z be in Ω and think of φ (z) as a fixed point inside the unit disk in the
w-plane. Consider the linear fractional transformation

τz (w) =

w − φ (z)
1 − φ (z)w

(7.5.7)

This is a one-to-one mapping from the unit disk onto itself and from the unit circle
onto itself; see Proposition 4.6.2. Let us compose τz with φ and define

This is a function of two variables z and ζ , but we often think of it as a function

Φ (z, z) = 0 (Figure 7.101).

Using Φ (z, ζ ) in place of φ (ζ ) in (7.5.4), we are able to reproduce the value of

Theorem 7.5.2. (Green’s Functions) Suppose that Ω is a simply connected region
with boundary Γ , and φ is a one-to-one analytic function on Ω and its boundary
onto the unit disk and its boundary. Let u be a function that is harmonic on Ω and

is called the Green’s function for the region Ω . Formula (7.5.9) is a generalized
Poisson integral formula for the simply connected region Ω .
Green’s function plays a fundamental role in the solution of important partial
differential equations (Laplace’s equation and Poisson’s equation).
Like the Poisson formulas on the disk and in the upper half-plane, formula (7.5.9)
can be used to solve a general Dirichlet problem in a simply connected region Ω ,
where the boundary data is piecewise continuous. Of course, this solution depends
on the explicit formula for the conformal mapping of Ω onto the unit disk. Once
this mapping is determined, Green’s functions can be used to solve the Dirichlet
problem. We illustrate these ideas with several examples and show how we can
recapture the Poisson formulas from Green’s functions.
We often write the Green’s function G(z, ζ ) in terms of the real and imaginary
parts of z = x + i y and ζ = s + it. We also write the Green’s function using polar
coordinates of z and ζ , where z = reiθ and ζ = ρ eiη .

that the Green’s function for the unit disk in polar coordinates is

at a specific point z = 25 in the unit disk.

and (7.5.11) follows upon replacing z by
reiθ and ζ by ρ eiη .
The plot of the function G( 25 , ζ ) on
the unit disk is shown in Figure 7.102.

Before we move to the next example, let us understand the role of Φ (z, ζ ) in
(7.5.8). Since Φ is the composition of two conformal mappings, it is itself a conformal mapping of Ω onto the unit disk, and from (7.5.8) we have Φ (z, z) = 0. By
the Riemann mapping theorem, Φ (z, ζ ) is uniquely determined by these properties,
up to a unimodular multiplicative constant. In particular |Φ (z, ζ )| is uniquely determined and so is the Green’s function for the region. (The uniqueness part in the
Riemann mapping theorem is not difficult to prove, and so we are not appealing to
a deep result here.) Consider, for example, the linear fractional transformation

τ (ζ ) =

z−ζ
z−ζ

where z is in the upper half-plane. If ζ is real so that ζ = ζ , then

Thus τ maps the real line onto the unit circle, and since it takes z onto the origin, it
follows that τ maps the upper half-plane onto the unit disk, and thus τ (ζ ) = Φ (z, ζ )
for the upper half-plane.
Example 7.5.5. (Green’s function and Poisson’s formula in the upper halfplane) (a) Show that the Green’s function for the upper half-plane is

Fix z = 1 + i in the upper half-plane, and plot the function ζ → G(1 + i, ζ ), for ζ in
the upper half-plane. This is Green’s function for the upper half-plane anchored at a
specific point z = 1 + i in the upper half-plane.
(b) Derive the Poisson integral formula for the upper half-plane.
Solution. (a) According to (7.5.10),
Green’s function for the upper halfplane is ln |Φ (z, ζ )| where Φ (z, ζ ) is in

Next we prove next some interesting properties of Green’s functions.
Theorem 7.5.7. (Properties of Green’s Functions) Suppose that Ω is a simply
connected region with boundary Γ , and let φ , Φ (z, ζ ), and G(z, ζ ) be as in Theorem 7.5.2. Then the Green’s function G has the following properties:
(i) G(z, ζ ) ≤ 0 for all z and ζ in Ω ;
(ii) G(z, ζ ) = 0 for all z in Ω and ζ on Γ ;
(iii) G(z, ζ ) = G(ζ , z) for all z and ζ in Ω (symmetric property);
(iv) for each z in Ω , there is a function ζ → u1 (z, ζ ) such that u1 (z, ζ ) is harmonic for all ζ in Ω , u1 (z, ζ ) = − ln |z − ζ | for all ζ on the boundary Γ , and
G(z, ζ ) = u1 (z, ζ ) + ln |z − ζ | for all ζ = z in Ω .
Properties (i) and (ii) could be verified on the graphs of the Green’s functions in
Figures 7.102 and 7.103. Before we prove the theorem, we illustrate the properties
in Figure 7.105 for a typical case where Ω is the upper half-plane and Green’s
function is anchored at z = 1 + i.

Fig. 7.105 A Green’s function G(z0 , ζ ) anchored at z0 = 1 + i is the sum of a logarithm, ln |z0 − ζ |,
and a harmonic function, u1 (ζ ), such that u1 (ζ ) = − ln |z0 − ζ | on the boundary. As a result,
G(z0 , ζ ) vanishes on the boundary and has a singularity at z0 like ln |z0 − ζ |.

Proof. Fix z in Ω . From the definition of φ and Φ (see (7.5.7) and (7.5.8)), we have
that Φ (z, ζ ) is in the open unit disk D (i.e., |Φ (z, ζ )| < 1) for all ζ in Ω and Φ (z, ζ )
is on the unit circle C (i.e., |Φ (z, ζ )| = 1) for all ζ on Γ . This clearly proves (i) and
(ii), because ln |x| < 0 if |x| < 1 and ln |x| = 0 if |x| = 1. For (iii), we have

(ζ = z in Ω ).

Clearly, ψ (z, ζ ) is analytic for all ζ = z in Ω . What happens as ζ approaches z? We

which is finite because |φ (z)| < 1 and nonzero because φ is one-to-one and so
φ  (z) = 0. Hence ψ (z, ζ ) has a removable singularity at z (Theorem 4.5.12). By
defining ψ at ζ = z to be
φ  (z)
ψ (z, z) =

1 − |φ (z)|2

ψ (z, ζ ) becomes analytic and nonzero for all ζ in Ω . Set u1 (z, ζ ) = ln |ψ (z, ζ )|;

7.5 Green’s Functions

Because the function ζ → u1 (z, ζ ) is the solution of a Dirichlet problem in Ω
with boundary values − ln |z − ζ |, if Ω is bounded, this solution is unique. Thus
the representation of Green’s function in Theorem 7.5.7(iv) is unique when Ω is
bounded. Property (iv) in Theorem 7.5.7 can be used to define the Green’s function
of a domain. That is, any function G(z, ζ ) that satisfies (iv) also satisfies (7.5.9).

Proof of the change of variables formula (7.5.3)
Suppose that γ (t) = x(t) + i y(t) is a
parametrization of a smooth path with
γ  (t) = x (t) + i y (t) = 0, where t lies in
some interval. If we assume our path has
a positive orientation, then an outward
unit normal may be obtained by rotating the tangent γ  (t) clockwise by π /2
and dividing by its absolute value (Fig

7.6 Poisson’s Equation and Neumann Problems
In this section we use Green’s functions to solve the Poisson boundary value problem on a region Ω , then apply similar techniques to solve another important type
of problem known as a Neumann problem. Suppose h is a continuous function on
the region Ω and f is a piecewise continuous function on the boundary Γ of Ω ,
which is a closed simple curve with positive orientation. We start with the Poisson
problem, which consists of the inhomogeneous Laplace equation known as Poisson’s equation along with a condition specifying the values of the function on the
boundary Γ of Ω (Figure 7.116):

Δ u(z) = h(z) for all z in Ω ;
u(ζ ) = f (ζ ) for all ζ on Γ .
This equation models, for example, the
time-independent (or steady-state) temperature distribution in a medium in the presence of heat sources. It also arises in the
study of the velocity potential of an incompressible ideal fluid flow in the presence of
sources or sinks. In this section we show
that the solution of (7.6.1)–(7.6.2) has a
simple expression in terms of the Green’s
function of Ω . Obviously, if h is identically
0 in Ω , (7.6.1) reduces to Laplace’s equation.

Before we solve the problem, we would like to state the following simple but
important superposition principle.
Theorem 7.6.1. (Superposition Principle) Suppose that u1 satisfies (7.6.1) in Ω
and u1 (ζ ) = 0 for all ζ on Γ . Suppose that u2 satisfies Laplace’s equation in Ω and
u2 (ζ ) = f (ζ ) for all ζ on Γ . Then u = u1 + u2 satisfies Poisson’s equation (7.6.1)
with boundary conditions (7.6.2).
The proof is immediate and is omitted. Theorem 7.6.1 allows us to decompose
the general Poisson problem (7.6.1)–(7.6.2) into the sum of a Dirichlet problem with
boundary values f and a Poisson problem with zero boundary values as illustrated
in Figure 7.117.

Our next goal is to derive Green’s identities. To do so, we make use of Green’s
theorem. This is stated in Theorem 3.4.2 for simply connected regions. For multiply
connected regions, the version goes as follows: Let p(x, y) and q(x, y) have continuous first partial derivatives in Ω and on its positively oriented boundary Γ . Then
we have

Theorem 7.6.2. (Green’s Identities) Suppose that Ω is a bounded region whose
boundary Γ consists of a finite number of simple closed positively oriented paths
(as in Theorem 3.7.2). Let u and v have continuous second partial derivatives on Ω
and Γ . Then we have Green’s first identity

parametrized by γ (t) = x(t) + i y(t), t in some interval, the outward unit normal may

n(t) =

∂v
ds = (vx , vy ) · (y (t), −x (t)) dt = vx dy − vy dx,

which shows that the right side of (7.6.6) is the same as the right side of (7.6.4), and
so (7.6.4) follows. To prove (7.6.5), we reverse the roles of u and v in (7.6.4) and get

Subtracting this from (7.6.4), we deduce (7.6.5).

We now express the solution of the Poisson problem on Ω in terms of Green’s
functions. We use the notation of the previous section and suppose that f and h in
(7.6.1)–(7.6.2) have enough smoothness and integrability properties for the formulas
to hold.
Theorem 7.6.3. (Solution of Poisson’s Problem) Suppose that Ω is a region with
boundary Γ , h is a continuous function on Ω and f a piecewise continuous function
on Γ . Let G(z, ζ ) denote the Green’s function for Ω . If u(z) is a solution of Poisson’s

Remark 7.6.4. The proof of this theorem uses Green’s identities (7.6.4) and (7.6.5).
These identities do not hold in general on unbounded regions. For this result we
suppose that the region Ω is bounded in the proof below. Nevertheless, formula
(7.6.7) can be used on unbounded regions and its validity there can be checked on a
case-by-case basis.
Proof. Fix z in Ω , and let Bε (z) denote the closed disk of radius ε > 0 centered at z
in Ω , and Ωε = Ω \ Bε (z). We are going to apply Green’s second identity in Ωε .

also have Δ u = h because u satisfies

Remark 7.6.5. The form (7.6.7) of the solution clearly illustrates the superposition
principle. We recognize the second term on the right side of (7.6.7) as the solution of

as a solution of Poisson’s equation (7.6.1) with zero boundary values.
It should be mentioned that in most situations it is difficult to compute (7.6.7)
in its present form. We now turn our attention to a different problem, which can be
solved using an approach similar to the one we took with Green’s functions.

Neumann Condition and Neumann Problems
When modeling heat problems in an insulated
plate Ω , where heat exchange on the boundary is prescribed, we are led to a boundary
value problem that consists of Laplace’s equation along with a condition that describes the
values of the normal derivative on the boundary (Figure 7.119):

problem of the second kind. Condition (7.6.13) is known as a Neumann condition. The normal derivative at the boundary describes the rate of exchange of heat
with the surrounding medium or the flux of heat across the boundary. For example,
the condition f (ζ ) = 0 corresponds to an insulated point where there is no exchange
of heat with the surrounding medium. Since f (ζ ) represents the flux of heat across
the boundary of u and u represents a steady-state temperature distribution inside Ω ,
we would expect the total flux across the boundary to be zero; that is, f cannot be
arbitrary, and it has to satisfy the compatibility condition

Indeed, (7.6.14) follows from the following useful property of harmonic functions,

Since Δ u = 0, the proposition follows.

In a Neumann problem, we are asked to find a harmonic function in terms of the
values of its normal derivative on the boundary. Such a solution is not unique, since
we can add an arbitrary constant to a solution of (7.6.12)–(7.6.13) and get another
solution. So now we ask: Is the solution unique up to an arbitrary constant? The
answer is affirmative. To show this, consider the difference between two solutions,
which is harmonic and has zero normal derivative on the boundary. As we now
show, a function that is harmonic and has zero normal derivative is a constant.
Theorem 7.6.7. (Uniqueness of the Neumann solution) Suppose that u is harmonic on a bounded region Ω such that ∂∂ un = 0 on the boundary Γ of Ω . Then u is
identically constant in Ω .
Proof. Suppose that u is harmonic in Ω and take u = v in Green’s first formula, so
that Δ v = 0 in Ω , and get

because ∂∂ un = 0 on Γ . Now the function ∇u · ∇u = (ux )2 + (uy )2 is nonnegative and
continuous on Ω . The only way for a nonnegative continuous function to integrate to
zero is to vanish identically (Lemma 3.9.5(i) proves this result in dimension one, but

476

7 Conformal Mappings

the argument also works in higher dimensions.) Hence (ux )2 + (uy )2 is identically
zero in Ω , and so ux = 0 and uy = 0 identically in Ω . Applying Theorem 2.4.7, we

see that u is constant on Ω .
In order to express the solution of the Neumann problem as an integral, motivated by Green’s function and the solution of the Dirichlet problem, we make the
following definition.
Definition 7.6.8. (Neumann Functions) Suppose that Ω is a simply connected region with boundary Γ . Let z, ζ in Ω . A Neumann function for the region Ω is a
function N(z, ζ ) with the following properties:
(i) for each z in Ω , N(z, ζ ) is harmonic in ζ on Ω \ {z};
(ii) ∂∂Nn (z, ζ ) = C for all z in Ω and ζ on Γ ;
(iii) for each z in Ω , there is a function ζ → u1 (z, ζ ) such that u1 (z, ζ ) is harmonic
in ζ on Ω , and N(z, ζ ) = ln |z − ζ | + u1 (z, ζ ) for all ζ in Ω \ {z}.
Parts (i) and (iii) state that Neumann functions, like Green’s functions, are harmonic
inside Ω except for a singularity at z = ζ , which is similar to the singularity of
ln |z − ζ |. Part (ii) tells us that the boundary values of the normal derivative of the
Neumann function are constant. This is the counterpart of the boundary condition
for a Green’s function, which states that a Green’s function must vanish identically
on the boundary. As we now show, the constant C in (ii) depends on the length of
the boundary Γ .
Proposition 7.6.9. The constant C in Definition 7.6.8 (ii), which represents the
boundary value of the normal derivative of the Neumann function, is equal to

Neumann functions are not unique for a region (two Neumann functions can differ by a function of z and not ζ ; see Exercise 12). However, any Neumann function
satisfying Definition 7.6.8 will work to solve a Neumann problem. Before we express the solution of the Neumann problem in terms of the Neumann function, we
note that from Theorem 7.6.7 if a solution of a Neumann problem exists, then it is
unique up to an additive constant.
Theorem 7.6.10. (Solution of the Neumann Problem) Suppose that Ω is a region
bounded by a simple path Γ , and let N(z, ζ ) denote a Neumann function, where z
and ζ are in Ω . Then, up to an additive constant, the solution u(z) of the Neumann

tive of 12 ln |z − ζ | + 12 ln |z − ζ | zero along the real axis. This shows that N(z, ζ ) as
defined by (7.6.20) has 0 normal derivative along the boundary, in accordance with
Proposition 7.6.9. All other properties of the Neumann function in Definition 7.6.8
are easily verified.

The fact that the normal derivative of the Neumann function of an unbounded
region is zero on the boundary allows us to construct the Neumann function for this
region by using the Neumann function for the upper half-plane and a change of variables via a conformal mapping. More precisely, we have the following construction,
which is valid for unbounded regions.
Proposition 7.6.12. (Neumann Function for Unbounded Regions) Suppose that
Ω is an unbounded region with boundary Γ , and φ is a one-to-one analytic mapping
of Ω onto the upper half-plane, taking Γ onto the real axis. Then the Neumann
function for Ω is
N(z, ζ ) = ln |φ (z) − φ (ζ )| + ln |φ (z) − φ (ζ )| (z, ζ in Ω ).

(7.6.21)

Proof. Fix z in Ω and consider the function F(w) = ln |φ (z) − w| + ln |φ (z) − w|,
where φ (z) and w are in the upper half-plane. By Example 7.6.11, ∂∂Fn (w) = 0, for
all w on the real axis. Applying the change of variables formula (7.5.3) it follows
φ
that ∂ F◦
∂ n (ζ ) = 0 for all ζ on Γ . So N(z, ζ ) has the right normal derivative on the
boundary Γ . Does it have the right singularity at ζ = z? Since φ (z) is in the lower
half-plane, it follows that ln |φ (z) − φ (ζ )| is harmonic for all ζ in Ω . Now let us
compare ln |φ (z) − φ (ζ )| to ln |z − ζ |. We have

because φ is analytic. Since φ  (z) = 0, ln |φ (z) − φ (ζ )| and ln |z − ζ | differ by a
finite constant near z. Hence the function N(z, ζ ) equals ln |z − ζ | plus a harmonic

Solution. Applying Proposition 7.6.12 with φ (z) = z2 , we
obtain that the Neumann function
for the first quadrant is
N(z, ζ ) = ln |z2 − ζ 2 |+ln |z2 − ζ 2 | .

The Neumann function for the
first quadrant anchored at the
point z = 1 + i is shown in Figure 7.121. Using properties of the
real logarithm we rewrite N(z, ζ )
as

Re
Fig. 7.121 A Neumann function.

N(z, ζ ) = ln |z − ζ | + ln |z + ζ | + ln |z − ζ | + ln |z + ζ |.
Finding Neumann functions for bounded regions is more difficult because the
condition ∂∂Nn = C is not preserved by a conformal mapping φ (z); the normal derivative is scaled by |φ  (z)|. In the exercises, we will compute the Neumann function for
the unit disk.
What if we are to solve Poisson’s equation (7.6.1) with Neumann boundary conditions (7.6.13)? The compatibility condition on h and f has already been handled
by (7.6.16); it is

This problem is also solvable with the Neumann function, and for reference, we

Theorem 7.6.14. (Solution of Poisson-Neumann Problem) Suppose that Ω is a
region with boundary Γ , let N(z, ζ ) denote a Neumann function for this region,
where z and ζ are in Ω . If u is a solution to Poisson’s equation (7.6.1) subject to
a Neumann boundary condition (7.6.13) satisfying (7.6.22), then up to an additive

12. Project Problem: On the uniqueness of the Neumann function. Suppose we have two
Neumann functions N1 (z, ζ ) and N2 (z, ζ ) for the same region Ω . They can be written in the form
N1 (z, ζ ) = ln |z − ζ | + u1 (z, ζ ), N2 (z, ζ ) = ln |z − ζ | + u2 (z, ζ ), where u1 and u2 are harmonic
functions of ζ .
(a) Show that N2 − N1 is harmonic. What is its normal derivative on Γ , the boundary of Ω ?
(b) Apply Theorem 7.6.7 and conclude that N1 and N2 differ by a constant–that is, an expression
independent of ζ . Can this expression depend on z?
(c) Conclude that N1 (z, ζ ) and N2 (z, ζ ) are two Neumann functions for the same region if and only
if they differ by any function of z alone.
13. Project Problem: Symmetry of the Neumann function. Unlike Theorem 7.5.7 for Green’s
functions, Definition 7.6.8 for Neumann functions does not mention that they are symmetric, and
in general it is not the case that N(z, ζ ) = N(ζ , z). In this problem we discover that symmetry can
be recaptured by imposing an extra condition on the Neumann function and that this can always be
done without disrupting its role in the solution of the Neumann-Poisson problem.
(a) Refer to Exercise 12. We may add a function of z to a Neumann function and get another
Neumann function. Let N(z, ζ ) be a Neumann function for Ω . Show that we can find a function
F(z) and a Neumann function N0 (z, ζ ) = N(z, ζ ) − F(z) such that Γ N0 (z, ζ ) ds (ds = |d ζ |) is
independent of z. (It is crucial that Γ has finite length.)
(b) Applying Green’s second identity to N(z1 , ζ ) and N(z2 , ζ ) over the region Ωε and taking the
limit as ε → 0 (as in the proof of Theorem 7.6.3), we get

Use the fact that the normal derivative of N(z, ζ ) is C (a constant) and part (a) to conclude that
N0 (z, ζ ) = N0 (ζ , z).
(c) As a double-check, replace N(z, ζ ) by N0 (z, ζ ) in (7.6.23) and show that the equation remains
unchanged. [Hint: Remember that F(z) is a constant as far as the integration is concerned, and use
the compatibility condition (7.6.22).]
14. Neumann problem with odd boundary data. Consider a Neumann problem in the unit disk
in which f (ζ ) = f (eiθ ) is an odd function of θ , where −π ≤ θ ≤ π . Show that u(z) = 0 for all
z on the real axis inside the unit disk. [Hint: The functions ln |z − eiθ | f (eiθ ) and ln | 1z − eiθ | f (eiθ )
are odd functions of θ if z is a real number.]

Appendix

Topology: Distance Between Sets
If K and S are two nonempty sets, the distance between K and S is defined to be the
smallest value of |z − w| where z is in K and
w is in S. If a smallest value is not attained,
we define the distance to be the infimum of
all |z − w|, where z ∈ K and w ∈ S. It is a fact
that if K is a closed and bounded subset of
C and S is a closed subset of C, and K and
S are disjoint, then the distance between K
and S is positive and is attained for a pair of
points (z0 , w0 ) in K × S.

Topology: Compact Sets
A subset of the plane is compact if and only if it is bounded and closed. Compact sets are characterized by the property that every open cover has a finite subcover. Precisely, suppose that K is a
compact subsetof C and {U j } j∈J is a (possibly uncountable) family of open subsets of the plane
such that K ⊂ j∈J U j . Then there is a finite subset J0 of J such that
K⊂



Uj ,

j∈J0

i.e., K is contained in a finite subcover of the cover {U j } j∈J .

Analysis: Uniform Continuity
A function f on a set S is called uniformly continuous if for every ε > 0 there is a δ > 0 such
that for all z1 and z2 in S, |z1 − z2 | < δ ⇒ | f (z1 ) − f (z2 )| < ε .
The key word in the definition of uniform continuity is “for all” which expresses the fact that
for a given ε , the choice of δ is the same for all points in S; in the definition of continuity at a
point, the choice of δ depends on the given point. Clearly, any uniformly continuous function is
continuous but the converse is not true. For instance the continuous function x2 is not uniformly
continuous on (0, ∞).
Theorem. Every continuous function on a closed and bounded (compact) subset S of the plane is
uniformly continuous.
Proof. Let ε > 0 and let z be a point in S. Then there is a δz > 0 such that
w∈S

and |w − z| < δz =⇒ | f (w) − f (z)| <

ε
.

The family {Bδz /2 (z)}z∈S is a open cover of S, and by compactness, it has an open subcover
{Bδz /2 (z1 ), . . . , Bδzm /2 (zm )}. Let δ = min(δz1 /2, . . . , δzm /2). Then for |z − w| < δ there is a j in

implies |w − z j | < δz j . Then we have

since both w and z satisfy |w − z j |, |z − z j | < δz j . This yields the uniform continuity of f on S. 

Analysis: The nonempty intersection property of compact sets

Proof. Let K1 ⊃ K2 ⊃ · · · ⊃ Kn ⊃ · · · be a decreasing sequence of nonempty compact subsets in
the plane. Suppose that ∩∞

But the sets Knc are open, and since their union covers K1 , by the compactness of K1 there is a finite
subcover of {Knc }∞
n=1 . Then there is an m such that

Knc = Kmc .

This implies that K1 is disjoint from Km which is a contradiction, since Km is contained in K1 . 

Analysis: The Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem
Lemma. Every real sequence has a monotone subsequence.
Proof. To prove this, let us call a positive integer n a “peak” of the sequence {xn }∞
n=1 if m > n =⇒
xn > xm . If the sequence {xn }∞
n=1 has infinitely many peaks, n1 < n2 < n3 < · · · < n j < · · · , then the
subsequence {xn j }∞j=1 corresponding to these peaks is monotonically decreasing. If the sequence
{xn }∞
n=1 has only finitely many peaks, let N be the last peak and n1 = N + 1. Then n1 is not a
peak, since n1 > N, which implies the existence of an n2 > n1 with xn2 ≥ xn1 . Again, n2 > n1 > N
is not a peak; hence, there is n3 > n2 with xn3 ≥ xn2 . Repeating this process leads to an infinite
non-decreasing subsequence xn1 ≤ xn2 ≤ xn3 ≤ . . .. In either case any real sequence {xn }∞
n=1 has a
monotone subsequence {xn j }∞j=1 .

Theorem. (Bolzano-Weierstrass) Every bounded sequence in the plane has a convergent subsequence.

Proof. Let zn = xn + iyn where xn , yn are real numbers. If {zn }∞

converge to their supremum if they are increasing or to their infimum if they are decreasing; both
